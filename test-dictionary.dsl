Absolute advantage
  The ability of an economic actor (an individual, a household or a firm) to produce some particular good or service with a smaller total input of economic resources (labor, capital, land, etc.) per unit of output than other economic actors. In analyzing the theory of trade and economic specialization , it is important to distinguish absolute from [ref]comparative advantage , since it is comparative advantage that determines the potential welfare gains from specialization and trade, and not absolute advantage. \[See also: comparative advantage \]

Acquittal
  The judgement of a court that a person charged with a crime has not been proved to be guilty. \[See also: conviction\]

Agency problem
  Also sometimes referred to as the principal-agent problem. The difficult but extremely important and recurrent organizational design problem of how organizations can structure [ref]incentives so that people (&quotagents&quot) who are placed in control over resources that are not their own with a [ref]contractual obligation to use these resources in the interests of some other person or group of people actually will perform this obligation as promised -- instead of using their delegated authority over other people's resources to feather their own nests at the expense of those whose interests they are supposed to be serving (their &quotprincipals&quot). Enforcing such contracts will involve transaction costs (often referred to as agency costs), and these costs may sometimes be very high indeed. Directors, managers and employees of [ref]business corporations are supposed to use their delegated authority to maximize the total financial returns from the business to its owners, the shareholders. Physicians, nurses, clinical psychologists, teachers, lawyers, CPAs, financial advisors and other service-oriented professionals are supposed to use their [ref]specialized knowledge and skills solely in the best interests of the patients, students or clients who have placed themselves (and some of their resources) in professional hands in exchange for the professionals' promises to act on their behalf. Government officials, judges and politicians in countries embracing the concept of popular sovereignty are instructed to use the power granted them to make public policy decisions that further some reasonable concept of &quotthe public interest&quot (usually conceived as the common interests of their constituents or of the country's citizenry at large). Trustees, managers, and employees of non-profit charitable institutions are supposed to use their control over their organization and its resources to promote the general purposes for which the institution was chartered and endowed. Yet if agents are really to perform consistently in the manner they are supposed to do (that is, in the interests of other people), they will need to be suitably motivated by some combination of [ref]material incentives , moral incentives , and/or coercive incentives that will make it seem worth their while to attend faithfully to their service obligations and fiduciary duties. The more autonomy that agents have to have in order to do their particular kind of work effectively and efficiently, the less useful coercive sanctions are likely to be, and the more important it becomes for agents' moral and material incentives to be appropriately aligned with their broader obligations to their principals. That is, organizations need to be structured in such a way so the agent will expect that diligently serving the interests of his or her principals will also be in his or her own long-run best interests. In order to accomplish this, the principals need to be reasonably clever in setting up the initial rules of the game that are set in the employment contract , sufficiently vigilant in keeping track of their agents' quality of performance over time, and willing to bear at least some minimum level of &quotagency costs&quot in order to provide the necessary [ref]incentives .

Agency problem - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Examples of some techniques commonly used to overcome or alleviate the agency problem would include: (1) profit-sharing bonuses, contingency fees, sales commissions, merit raises, executive stock options and various other contractually specified methods of setting the amount of the agent's financial compensation in proportion to measurable results; (2) organizational hiring and promotion policies for people in responsible positions (agents) that emphasize identifying and selecting candidates whose reputation (based ideally on past performance) indicate they are &quotwell-motivated,&quot&quotdedicated to the ethics of the profession,&quot and generally &quotof good character&quot -- i.e., people who feel a strong sense of moral obligation to do their best to do what they have promised to do, even when no one is likely to be watching; (3) institutional arrangements of accountability (such as boards of directors, auditing committees, inspector generals' offices, professional society ethics committees, and government regulatory boards) for detecting and then punishing extreme dereliction of duty, either by simply firing and disgracing (or perhaps de-licensing) the unworthy agent or possibly by aggressively pursuing civil or criminal penalties through the courts; (4) arrangements such as elections whereby the recent performance of the agent may be periodically scrutinized by his or her principals and competing candidates for the job may be allowed to make their case for replacing the incumbent agent by revealing his or her shortcomings and showing how performance might be improved through a change in command.

Agency problem-Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The bottom line, however, is that the agency problem can never be 100% solved in a world where virtually everyone has a healthy regard for their own self-interest and the relevant information for evaluating performance is imperfect, costly to obtain and unequally distributed between the agent and his principals. Indeed, [ref]rational principals will only pursue the available techniques for control to the point that the [ref]marginal increment in &quotagency costs&quot rise to equal the [ref]marginal benefits to them of the additional increment in &quotfaithfulness&quot that they produce. (That is to say, sometimes it is cheaper for principals to endure a certain amount of dereliction of duty by their agents than it is to pay for the precautions needed to prevent or punish it.) In some kinds of institutions -- especially those where results are not readily measurable with much precision, those where the nature of the agents' work is such as to require a very high degree of expert judgment, those where lines of responsibility and authority are very complex, those where agents work individually in widely dispersed work places, those where the agent's activities necessarily involve a lot of &quotjudgment calls&quot to cope with rapidly changing circumstances and highly uncertain information, and those where large numbers of principals have only relatively small individual &quotstakes&quot at risk -- the [ref]incentives for agents faithfully to represent their principals may easily become so weak as to be largely ineffective. Experience demonstrates that these kinds of organizations often come to be run mainly for the benefit of the agents (managers and other employees, service professionals, politicians, officials) rather than their purported principals (stockholders, voters, taxpayers, clients, etc.). Two of the important tasks of the academic disciplines of business administration and public administration are to identify, and then to devise cheaper substitutes or remedies for, organizational arrangements that are characterized by costly agency problems. \[See also: [ref]incentive , [ref]marginal analysis , [ref]bureaucracy , [ref]bureaucratic politics \] 

Aggregate demand
  Also more accurately referred to as aggregate expenditure, this is one of the key concepts introduced by John Maynard Keynes that still today is at the heart of most macroeconomic theories about the determination of the [ref]overall level of employment (and thus the level of national income produced) in a country's economy during a given year. Although there have turned out to be a number of logical problems and ambiguities in making the analogy work, Keynes's original basic notion was that &quotaggregate demand&quot represented a sort of grand total or summarization of all the various demand schedules for all the millions of different goods and services produced in a country's national economy. Thus, Keynes reasoned, just as the [ref]microeconomic theorist can fruitfully analyze the relationship between the various quantities of a particular good or service that will be purchased by consumers at various prices on a single market by means of a demand schedule or demand curve , the [ref]macroeconomic theorist can make similarly good use of an aggregate demand schedule or aggregate demand curve as a means for analyzing the relationship between the various possible grand totals of all goods and services purchased in the national economy (as measured by their total monetary value in the form of a national product estimate like GNP or GDP ) and the general price level (as measured by some sort of comprehensive price index rather like those whose yearly rates of change are commonly used to measure inflation). Once he had the brainstorm that one could sum up all the demand schedules for individual goods into a single grand total &quotaggregate demand schedule,&quot it was not much of a mental leap for Keynes to conclude that it might be useful first to divide up aggregate demand into a small number of &quotsubtotal&quot aggregate demand schedules whose interrelationships might help explain such large-scale macroeconomic phenomena as the business cycle , inflation , [ref]economic growth and the like. Thus Keynes invented most of the basic ideas of what is today the macroeconomists' conventional system of national income accounting when he formulated his famous aggregate demand identity Y = C + I + G + (X - M) which simply means that a single country's aggregate demand for national product (Y) is always equal to the total demands of its households for Consumer goods and services (C), plus the total demands of its firms for Investment goods (I), plus the total demands of its various Government agencies for goods and services (G), plus the net demands of foreign consumers, firms and governments for the country's goods and services (exports minus imports). \[See also: aggregate supply , macroeconomics , [ref]Gross National Product , fiscal policy investment \]

Aggregate supply
  Another of the concepts introduced by John Maynard Keynes that still today are used in macroeconomic theories about the determination of the [ref]overall level of employment and national income. Like his concept of aggregate demand , the basic notion of aggregate supply was created by analogy to a microeconomic concept originally applying only to an analysis of the market for a single product -- in this case, the concept of a supply schedule . Thus, Keynes reasoned, just as the [ref]microeconomic theorist can fruitfully analyze the relationship between the various quantities of a particular good or service that will be produced and offered for sale by firms at various prices on a single market by means of a supply schedule or supply curve , the [ref]macroeconomic theorist can make similarly good use of an aggregate supply schedule or aggregate supply curve to depict the relationship between the various possible grand totals of all goods and services produced and offered for sale in the national economy (as measured by their total monetary value in the form of a national product estimate like GNP or GDP ) and the general price level (as measured by some sort of comprehensive price index rather like those whose yearly rates of change are commonly used to measure inflation). \[See also: aggregate demand , macroeconomics , [ref]Gross National Product (GNP) , fiscal policy \]

Allocation
  The division of things into shares or portions. In economics, the term refers primarily to the &quot;allocation of resources,&quot; the process by which [ref]economic resources get allotted (apportioned, assigned) to their particular uses for directly or indirectly [ref]satisfying human wants. The allocation process in a particular society's economy is the process by which the three fundamental economic questions get answered in that society: What goods and services are produced (and in what quantities)? By which of the various available technological means and recipes are each of these goods and services to be produced from the available land, labor and capital? For whom are each of these goods and services produced? (Which specific individuals get to use/consume each unit of each good or service produced?) [ref]Thus one may speak of &quot;market allocation&quot; of resources, &quot;forcible allocation&quot; of resources, &quot;governmental allocation&quot; of resources, &quot;traditional&quot; (or &quot;customary&quot;) allocation of resources and so on, depending upon the kinds of social processes and incentives by which various sorts of scarce resources are allocated in the particular society under consideration. \[See also: factors of production\]

Anarchism
  Any of a variety of [ref]ideologies sharing the fundamental belief that the state and all similar forms of governmental authority are unjustified and oppressive and [ref]illegitimate and therefore ought to be abolished, with future social and economic cooperation to be carried out only by means of voluntary relationships and consensual agreements under conditions of perfect legal [ref]equality. \[See also: state, legitimacy, ideology, socialism\]

Appropriation bill
appropriation
  A (proposed) formal action by a legislative assembly (such as the U.S. Congress or a state legislature) that specifies exact amounts of the government's money that the Treasury may legally pay out (through new hiring, contracts for purchases, findings of individuals' eligibility for income transfer payments, etc.) for each of a list of particular pre-authorized programs carried out by governmental agencies over a specific period of time (normally one year). \[See also: authorization bill \]

Aristocracy
  A privileged social class whose members possess disproportionately large shares of a society's wealth, social prestige, educational attainment and political influence, with these advantages having been acquired principally through gift or inheritance from a long line of similarly privileged and cultivated ancestors. The term refers also to a form of government in which the state is effectively controlled by the members of such a class. The term tends to have a somewhat unsavory or derogatory connotation today in the light of [ref]democratic theories, but in classical political philosophy it meant rule by &quot;the best people&quot; of the society, who were expected to feel a paternalistic concern for the humbler members of the society that would keep them from [ref]ruling in a purely self-seeking fashion. \[See also: oligarchy\]

Authorization bill
authorization
  A (proposed) formal act (or &quotlaw&quot) of a legislative body (such as the U.S. Congress or a state legislature) that legally establishes a new government agency or program or else renews or extends an existing agency or program whose previous legal authorization to exist would otherwise expire with the passage of time. Authorizations may be for one year or more than one year -- about one-half of current Federal spending is by agencies or programs subject to annual re-authorization, while the other half gets its legal basis either from longer term authorization bills or from permanent laws that provide spending authority automatically to ongoing entitlement programs like Social Security. Authorization bills also include specific figures as funding levels for the agencies and programs, but these sums are upper limits only (for the guidance of the appropriations committee) -- no money can actually be spent or committed by the agency or program administrators until after a separate appropriation bill has also been passed and signed into law, legally enabling the Treasury to disburse the money. The amount of money eventually appropriated for an agency or program is most often less than the amount previously authorized, so an authorization bill is rather like a necessary &quothunting license&quot for an appropriation rather than a guarantee. No appropriation can be made for an unauthorized program, but even an authorized program may still die or be unable to perform all its assigned functions for lack of a sufficiently large appropriation of funds. This often happens in the decentralized American political system, because authorization bills are each drafted by one of the many specialized standing committees in Congress (the Agriculture Committee, the Armed Forces Committee, etc. -- who tend to be cheerleaders for &quottheir&quot pet agencies), while appropriation bills are drafted by the different set of lawmakers who serve on the specialized subcommittees of the Appropriations committees in the two chambers (who still have to get their funding choices through the full Appropriations committee, which is responsible for weighing the relative merits and urgency of all the different programs against each other before dividing up the budget pie). \[See also: appropriation bill \]

Autocracy
  A system of government in which supreme political power to direct all the activities of the state is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints or nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of coup d'etat or mass insurrection). \[See also: dictatorship , totalitarianism , fascism \]

Banking
  In the broadest sense of the term, &quotbanking&quot is the business of accepting temporary responsibility for safeguarding other people's money (&quotdeposits&quot) and then lending out these funds (along with the bankers' own funds) in order to [ref]earn interest for the bank's own account. Banking firms thus earn their profits primarily by serving as &quotfinancial intermediaries&quot who mobilize the scattered savings of many households and firms (by offering safekeeping services and [ref]paying interest on at least some kinds of accounts) and then make these pooled funds available to suitable borrowers (to business firms that want to finance proposed investment projects or perhaps to consumers who want to finance big ticket durable consumers' goods like automobiles or perhaps to governmental entities whose policy-makers have decided to spend more money than they have received in revenue collections). The bank pledges its own capital (and also buys outside deposit insurance) to guarantee that any depositor can get all his/her money back in cash no later than some contractually specified length of time after giving notice of withdrawal. The bank makes this somewhat risky guarantee even though it is quite predictable that some (hopefully small) percentage of the loans the bankers make using depositers' funds will &quotturn sour&quot and not be repaid by the borrower. [ref]The bank's profits arise mainly from the (positive) spread between [ref]its costs of securing and servicing deposits and its revenues from fees and interest on the loans extended. (Of course banks frequently seek to make additional profits selling other financial services to their clients and customers as well, but the business of accepting deposits and making loans is the defining core of the banking business.) Not all firms engaging in &quotbanking&quot in this broad sense are officially called &quotbanks.&quot Savings and loan associations, credit unions and other miscellaneous thrift institutions provide similar services under other names. The laws of the United States and most other developed industrial countries provide for multiple types of financial intermediary institutions whose official &quotlabels&quot normally depend upon the selected purposes for which they will loan money (business loans, consumer loans, real estate mortgages, etc.), the maximum time period for which they will contract a loan (2 years? 5 years? 30 years?), and the kinds of supplementary services (checking privileges, foreign exchange, management of trusts and estates, etc.) that they may provide for their customers beyond basic taking of deposits and extension of loans. From the perspective of this course, banks are mainly of interest because of their key role in determining the size of the money stock. Considerably less than half of the [ref]US money stock (M1) consists of physical cash or currency (coins and bills). Most of the money stock in the US (or any other present-day advanced industrial economy) is in the form of &quotmere&quot ledger entries representing bank depositers' credit balances in their individual or corporate checking accounts. And, amazingly enough to the uninitiated, this means that banks are constantly creating money &quotout of thin air&quot simply by making bookkeeping entries that assign new checking account credits to customers as they take out loans from the bank. [ref]More...

Banking (Cont.)
Banking - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Of course, private banks cannot simply create money out of thin air without limit and still expect to stay in business. When the bank credits a borrower's account with the amount of his new loan, it is to be expected that the borrower will very soon want to spend part or all of the money he has borrowed. After the check the borrower writes is deposited in somebody else's account in another bank, the check will soon be presented for collection at the lending bank, and they will have to have the cash on hand to pay the other bank off at that time. The more dollars' worth of loans a bank has extended, the more cash it will have to have on hand in reserves to meet the daily flow of redemptions. Most or all of the check redemption demands coming in every day can normally be offset by the cash and checks drawn on other banks that the depositers and borrowers have brought in and deposited or paid that day, but an &quotunsound&quot bank that extends loans with reckless abandon sooner or later will find that the flow of checks presented to it for collection greatly exceeds the flow of outside checks and cash being brought in. Once the bank's vaults are empty and the cash reserves are gone, the management must quickly (overnight!) either borrow the necessary additional cash elsewhere (probably at [ref]high interest rates ) or else sell off some of the bank's assets (because of the haste, probably at fire-sale prices). When the troubled bank can no longer borrow and has no assets left that can be sold on short notice, it can no longer fulfill its ontractual guarantees to pay its obligations on demand and is therefore out of business with the banks owners and managers now subject to civil (and perhaps criminal) legal penalties (bankrupcy, suits for breach of contract, negligence, and fraud, indictments for fraud, embezzlement, etc.). &quotSound&quot banks limit the volume of the loans they extend so that they remain in a prudent proportional relationship to the amount of instantly liquid funds they have available in &quotreserves&quot (either as currency in the vault or as demand deposits in some other bank, such as the [ref]Federal Reserve ). But bankers face a difficult trade-off. The flow of checks that will be presented for payment and the volume of new deposits and loan repayments coming in every day cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy, so the higher the fraction of its total deposit obligations the bank holds ready in reserves, the safer or &quotsounder&quot the bank can be considered (and the more attractive the bank will seem to depositers and other potential business associates). However, reserves do not yield any [ref]interest income to the bank; only the funds that are tied up in loans to (solvent) borrowers can contribute directly and immediately to the bank's profitability. To [ref]maximize their profits , bank management must find the best way to strike a balance between the need to maintain their &quotreserve ratio&quot at a level high enough to limit their risks of becoming insolvent and the conflicting need to keep the highest feasible proportion of the bank's available funds loaned out at [ref]interest . \[See also: [ref]money stock , [ref]monetary policy , [ref]reserve requirement , [ref]Federal Reserve System \] 

Barriers to entry
  Conditions or circumstances that make it very difficult or [ref]unacceptably costly for outside firms to enter a particular market [ref]to compete with the established firm or firms that are already selling the good or service involved. These barriers may derive from several causes. Legal or regulatory or other clearly political barriers to entry are historically the most common source of long-lived [ref]monopolistic or [ref]cartelized conditions in the marketplace, either through overt grants of monopoly to politically favored firms or through the enactment of laws or decrees that have the same effect indirectly by [ref]imposing such high costs or delays for qualifying for licensure, permission to import across national boundaries, or other required regulatory clearances to sell in the marketplace that new competition is effectively discouraged without being specifically prohibited. The existence of legally enforceable patent protection may give the incumbent firm a big cost or quality advantage over other potential competitors -- at least as long as new and better products or production technologies have not been discovered or acquired by potential entrants. Even without political favoritism, an established firm or firms in the industry may also enjoy large initial cost advantages over new entrants due to the need for [ref]very large initial outlays in highly capital intensive industries where the available technology creates substantial economies of scale for the firm that has already made those outlays in the past. Laying out billions of dollars up front to enter a competition where long term success is highly uncertain may involve so much risk that only slightly higher-than-average [ref]profits in the industry will be insufficient to bring in new entrants, so if [ref]the monopolist is wise enough not to jack up prices too high above marginal costs he may avoid unpleasant competition for many years. Of course if the threat of potential competition causes the monopolist to moderate his behavior in this way, the adverse welfare effects people expect from monopoly may become relatively negligible in the process. (It is often suggested that extensive investment in product differentiation, years of expensive advertising, and the resulting cultivation of brand loyalty among the consumers can create difficult barriers to entry as well, although seemingly brand-loyal consumers often show a remarkable willingness to shift surprisingly quickly to new brands when they find clear evidence of superior quality or a major price advantage in doing so. Brainwashing the public does not come cheap -- and it often turns out to be far from permanent!) \[See also: monopoly, natural monopoly, competition, cartel\]

Barter
  Trading of goods or services directly for other goods or services, without using money or any other similar unit of account or medium of exchange. Although barter represents the earliest form of trade discovered by primitive man that made possible a more extensive division of labor beyond the limited bounds of a family or small clan grouping, it quickly encounters some practical limits to its efficiency as the division of labor becomes still more extensive and more [ref]specialized. Bartering requires what economists refer to as a &quot;double coincidence of wants.&quot; That is, for a voluntary barter exchange to take place, it is not enough for you just to find someone who has the exact good you want to acquire -- he must also happen to want to &quot;buy&quot; the particular good that you have to trade for it at the same time. Finding someone whose immediate needs exactly complement your own in this precise way may take quite a lot of searching, which is costly in terms of time and effort. The primitive partial solution to this matching problem is to make one or more intermediate swaps with still other people in order to acquire some other item that will be more acceptable to the owner of the item you desire -- but this will also tend to be very time-consuming. The more complex the division of labor, the more finely [ref]specialized the population's productive roles, and the more numerous the variety of goods and services produced in an economy, the more costly and cumbersome barter trading will become because the likelihood of any two people having a double coincidence of wants shrinks dramatically. History strongly suggests, in fact, that the (sometimes gradual, sometimes amazingly rapid) replacement of a barter economy by an [ref]exchange economy employing [ref]some form of money to facilitate trade is a near-absolute necessity before much economic development beyond a rather primitive tribal level can occur. \[See also: money, transaction costs\]

Black market
  A market in which certain goods or services are routinely traded in a manner contrary to the laws or regulations of the government in power. Typical reasons why the market goes underground in this way include the desire by substantial numbers of buyers and sellers to evade [ref]restrictive government price controls or inconvenient rationing schemes, to avoid paying heavy taxes on the good or service in question, or simply to be able to obtain [ref]forbidden goods or services that the government does not want the people to have at all . The size and relative importance of black markets vary greatly from one country to another and from one historical period to the next within any single country. In general, the greater the extent to which the [ref]government tries to dominate and control the economy , the larger the fraction of economic activity that takes place through the black market can be expected to be. Partially offsetting this tendency of more interventionist policies to spawn ever larger black markets, the size of the black market in any given country at any given time also reflects the size and effectiveness of the [ref]bureaucratic machinery the government mobilizes to catch people who violate its economic regulations and the [ref]severity of the punishments that are routinely inflicted on those who get caught. Thus it was surely no accident that the ultra-highly regulated economic institutions of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Eastern Europe and Communist China coexisted in symbiosis with gigantic regulatory and secret police establishments, extensive informer networks, crowded prison systems featuring thousands of slave labor camps, and frequent imposition of the death penalty for so-called &quoteconomic crimes.&quot The Nazi regime was destroyed by World War II before it was old enough to undergo any very extensive modifications, but it was surely no accident that even the first very tentative and partial gestures by the various Communist regimes to abolish or restrain many of their more extreme &quotpolice-state&quot practices during these last few decades quickly resulted in an enormous expansion of black market activity, despite the fact that these governments were also just beginning to loosen up their control of the economy at the same time. In the United States, government efforts to regulate and micro-manage the economy have historically been much less extensive than in Communist or socialist countries. In fact, the American commitment to the general ideal of &quotfree enterprise&quot has typically been considerably stronger than has been the case in virtually all of the more advanced industrialized Western countries. Nevertheless, we can easily identify at least a few rather large examples of the black market in the United States. First of all, the US government has typically been more ambitious and aggressive in its attempts to regulate and control economic activities during times of perceived national crisis (especially during wartime). World War II rationing and price controls were accompanied by extensive black market activity involving illegal dealings in meat, sugar, automobile parts, penicillin and other regulated commodities as well as widespread evasion of rent controls. [ref]More...

Black market (Cont.)
Black market - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Even in relatively normal times, however, there are important areas of black market activity in the US economy. First of all, and most clearly &quotcriminal&quot in the eyes of the general public, there is always a certain amount of illicit trade in stolen goods passed on directly (or indirectly, through &quotfences&quot) from burglars, jewel thieves, cattle rustlers, hijackers, shoplifters, light-fingered employees, and the like. In addition, black market trade remains very widespread (and probably still is growing) in [ref]certain demerit goods which remain strongly in demand, even though federal and/or state governments have sought to prohibit them entirely (narcotics and most other psychoactive recreational drugs, hard-core pornography, the services of prostitutes, false i.d. cards, ozone-depleting Freon for automobile air conditioners, Cuban cigars, the gall bladders of bears , products made from elephant tusks) or to [ref]monopolize the product [ref]in government hands (running of lotteries-for-profit, fully automatic firearms) or to [ref]tax them very heavily in a discriminatory fashion (moonshine whiskey, bootleg cigarettes). Heavy [ref]rates of taxation on otherwise perfectly legitimate wages, salaries, and unincorporated small business [ref]profits (currently a minimum federal tax take of 18% for income tax plus more than 15% for social security tax, even before beginning to tally up state and local income taxes and license fees) [ref]provide strong incentives for illegal working &quotoff the books&quot for cash to evade taxes, at least in [ref]low capital or temporary service occupations where government detection is unlikely and/or punishment would probably be mild (lawn care services, free-lance handymen, automobile mechanics, household servants, baby-sitters, plumbers, electricians, part-time beauticians, locksmiths, appliance repairmen, temporary day-laborers, computer consultants, tutors, etc.). Putting even an approximate number on the full extent of black market activity in the US (or in any country) is very hard to do and necessarily rather imprecise, but, for what it is worth, economists who have made serious and systematic efforts at estimation claim that black market activity probably amounts to at least 10% of [ref]US GNP . In many Third World countries (which tend to put a tremendous number of detailed economic regulations on the books but have only very inefficient [ref]bureaucratic capabilities for enforcing them), black market activity is believed to produce well over half of [ref]GNP . 

Budget
  A statement of a government's planned or expected financial position for a specified period of time (usually one year) based on estimates of the expenditures to be made by the government's main subdivisions (wages and salaries of government employees; consultants' fees; purchases of equipment, supplies, real estate, etc.; money transferred to beneficiaries of various programs, and so on) during the specified period, along with estimates of the revenues to be realized from the various sources of income that will be available for paying for these expenditures. The budget of a government may be seen as a comprehensive plan of what the government will spend for its various programs during the next fiscal year and how it expects to raise the money to pay for them (tax receipts , charges for services, sale of assets, borrowing, new emissions of currency, etc.) Somewhat confusingly, the same term is used to denote both the advance estimate or plan of what the government will be taking in and spending and also the actual amounts that finally end up being taken in and spent -- even though the planned and actual numbers never really match perfectly when the returns come in! \[See also: budget deficit , budget surplus , fiscal policy \]

Budget deficit
  The amount by which total government spending is more than government income during a specified period; the amount of money which the government has to raise by borrowing or currency emission in order to make up for the shortfall in tax revenues. \[See also: budget, budget surplus, national debt, fiscal policy\]

Budget surplus
  The amount by which government revenues are more than government spending during a specified period. \[See also: budget, budget deficit, national debt, tax, fiscal policy\]

Bureaucracy
  In ordinary usage, &quotbureaucracy&quot refers to a complex, specialized organization (especially a governmental organization) composed of non-elected, highly trained professional administrators and clerks hired on a full-time basis to perform administrative services and tasks. Bureaucratic organizations are broken up into specialized departments or ministries, to each of which is assigned responsibility for pursuing a limited number of the government's many official goals and policies -- those falling within a single relatively narrow functional domain. The departments or ministries are subdivided into divisions that are each assigned even more specialized responsibilities for accomplishing various portions or aspects of the department's overall tasks, and these divisions are in turn composed of multiple agencies or bureaus with even more minutely specialized functions (and their own subdivisions). Bureaucratic organizations always rely heavily on the principle of hierarchy and rank, which requires a clear, unambiguous chain of command through which &quothigher&quot officials supervise the &quotlower&quot officials, who of course supervise their own subordinate administrators within the various subdivisions and sub-subdivisions of the organization. Bureaucratic organizations are typically charcterized by great attention to the precise and stable delineation of authority or jurisdiction among the various subdivisions and among the officials who comprise them, which is done mainly by requiring the organization's employees to operate strictly according to fixed procedures and detailed rules designed to routinize nearly all decision-making. Some of the most important of these rules and procedures may be specified in laws or decrees enacted by the higher &quotpolitical&quot authorities that are empowered to set the official goals and general policies for the organization, but upper-level (and even medium-level) bureaucrats typically are delegated considerable discretionary powers for elaborating their own detailed rules and procedures. Because the incentive structures of bureaucratic organizations largely involve rewarding strict adherence to formal rules and punishing unauthorized departures from standard operating procedures (rather than focussing on measureable individual contributions toward actually attaining the organization's politically assigned goals), such organizations tend to rely very heavily upon extensive written records and standardized forms, which serve primarily to document the fact that all decisions about individual &quotcases&quot were taken in accordance with approved guidelines and procedures rather than merely reflecting the personal preferences or subjective judgment of the individual bureaucrat involved. The classic social scientific analysis of bureaucracy was that of the pioneer sociologist Max Weber in his 1922 book Economy and Society. Weber, like the good German he was, believed that a permanent, well-educated, conscientious, &quotnon-partisan,&quot Prussian-style bureaucracy professionally committed to implementing whatever decisions the legitimate rulers of the state might arrive at was the best organizational form yet discovered for the rational and efficient pursuit of collective social goals in a modern society with a [ref]specialized and highly complex division of labor . In his writings, Weber devoted considerable attention to showing ways in which the gradual evolution of modern bureaucratic methods and values helped to remove the formidable obstacles to economic development, social advancement and political stability that had been inherent in the much less professionalized and systematized practices of government administration in feudal Europe and most other premodern societies.

Bureaucracy (Cont.)
Bureaucracy - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  While most other social scientific students of bureaucracy have recognized the historical importance of bureaucratic organizational techniques in creating the powerful, centralized [ref]nation-states (and other very large organizations such as modern business [ref]corporations and labor unions) that predominate in the industrialized world of the 20th century, it is fair to say that they have generally been considerably less one-sidedly approving of bureaucracy than Weber was. Despite their many advantages for dealing efficiently and effectively with routine, recurring problems in a fairly stable and predictable environment, bureaucratic methods also have their dark side. Hired and promoted largely on the basis of educational credentials and seniority within the organization and protected by civil service personnel practices designed to provide a high degree of job security, bureaucratic officials tend to be very well insulated from responsibility for the external consequences of their decisions and actions as long as they stay formally within prescribed procedures. Such sociologists as Robert K. Merton and Michel Crozier have shown that pressures on officials to conform to fixed rules and detailed procedures, when added to the narrow responsibilities of highly specialized agencies for pursuing only a select few of the many objectives that government has set, quite regularly leads bureaucrats to become defensive, rigid, and completely unresponsive to the urgent individual needs and concerns of the private citizens and outside organizations with which they come into professional contact. (&quotThat's not my department. I cannot help you.&quot) Because the salaries and promotion prospects of officials working in large bureaucracies seldom depend upon measurable success or [ref]efficiency by the organization in achieving its larger goals (which are often especially difficult to measure in government agencies and other non-profit oriented organizations that lack a clear &quotbottom line&quot) and because any departure from established routines always requires permission from remote higher levels of the hierarchy, large bureaucratic organizations tend to be very slow and cumbersome in making important policy decisions (the &quotbuck-passing&quot phenomenon) and are especially dull-witted in recognizing and responding to the consequences of major changes in economic, social and technological conditions and circumstances outside the organization itself. In other words, individual officials working under bureaucratic [ref]incentive systems frequently find it to be in their own best interests to adhere rigidly to internal rules and formalities in a ritualistic fashion, behaving as if &quotproper procedure&quot were more important than the larger goals for serving their clients or the general public that they are supposedly designed to accomplish (the &quotred tape&quot phenomenon). \[See also: [ref]agency problem, [ref]state, [ref]incentive, [ref]bureaucratic politics\] 

Bureaucratic politics
  Bureaucratic politics theories or explanations of why particular public policy decisions got made the way they did stress the motivation by the relevant officials in the government bureaucracy to protect or promote their own agency's special interests (in competition with other agencies) as a major motivating factor in shaping the timing and the content of government decisions. Each bureau (or other governmental sub-division) continually strives to maximize its budget and its authorized manpower, as well as to protect or extend its operating autonomy and discretion in decision-making in the area of its assigned responsibilities. Often this can be most readily accomplished by lobbying for an expansion of the scope of the bureau's responsibilities that are prescribed by Congress or the legislature. Because bureaucratic agencies are in competition with each other for budget shares and for personnel allocations as well as for gaining responsibility for juicy new programs justifying expansion, the policies and policy recommendations generated in the executive branch of the government and passed on to both the chief executive and the legislative authorities are often better understood as the by-product of bureaucratic turf-battles and expedient compromises between bureaucratic chieftains than as the product of reasoned analysis of how most effectively and efficiently to carry out the policy commitments of the elected chief executive or to serve the public interest. \[See also: bureaucracy, rational-comprehensive decision-making, incrementalism\]

Business cycle
  More or less regular swings or wave-like fluctuations in the pace of a country's [ref]economic growth , well above and well below the long-term trend in the growth rate of total production; the ups and downs of overall business activity, as evidenced by surges and declines in GNP and GDP , unemployment rates , and the [ref]general price level ; the boom-and-bust pattern of [ref]recession (or depression) and recovery. In older economic literature (and still today in British usage) the term &quottrade cycle&quot is often used as a synonym for &quotbusiness cycle.&quot What causes business cycles has been one of the hottest and longest running theoretical debates in political economy. There is a fair amount of agreement on what at least some of the factors are that are associated with the alternation of economic booms and busts, but different schools of thought differ considerably in the relative weight and the causal priority they assign to these various factors. Some schools of thought emphasize uneven government economic policies as the principal cause of business cycles, while others see government economic policies as the key influences working to even out business cycles allegedly brought on by inherent features of the market economy. Nearly all of these competing theories key in on one or more of the factors believed to influence the expansion and contraction of [ref]total saving by the public and of [ref]new capital investment undertaken by business firms as the most immediate causes of booms and busts in the larger economy. John Maynard Keynes's explanation of the business cycle emphasized periodic shifts in the public's allocation of their incomes between current spending for immediate consumption and savings for future consumption -- which leads to shifts in the [ref]overall level of demand for consumers' goods, which in turn encourages producers of consumers' goods disproportionately to expand or contract their own purchases of producers's goods like [ref]raw materials and machinery (and labor ) more or less all at once in response to improvements or declines in their current sales. Keynes believed that the public typically tends to save too much and consume too little, thereby throttling aggregate (total) demand , unless the government steps in from time to time through its fiscal policies to artificially increase aggregate demand by spending more on goods and services than it takes away from consumers' purchasing power in [ref]taxes (&quotrunning a budget deficit &quot). [ref]More...

Business cycle (Cont.)
Business cycle - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Other non-Keynesian theorists of the business cycle have focussed on other (often psychological) factors besides the growth or decline of their current sales that influence businessmen's optimism or pessimism about future economic conditions (and hence their [ref]investment plans ). Still other theorists emphasize the role of occasional &quotsupply shocks&quot -- sudden and unexpected changes in the supply of key resources resulting from weather cycles, natural disasters, international conflicts, big regulatory or [ref]tax changes by government, etc. (For example, the formation of the [ref]OPEC oil producers' cartel and their two massive waves of concerted production cuts/price increases in the 1970s.) Joseph Schumpeter's theory of &quotcreative destruction&quot stresses the role of waves of massive innovation (major technological breakthroughs, introduction of major new products that create whole new industries) in precipitating major adjustments and reallocation of resources as old industries die and are replaced by new ones. &quotMonetarist&quot theories of the business cycle analyze the impact of shifts in decisions of the [ref]government monetary authorities (such as the Board of Governors of the [ref]U.S. Federal Reserve Banking System ) to expand or contract the [ref]money supply in their efforts to manipulate [ref]short-term interest rates and foreign exchange rates (often for [ref]selfish political reasons ). [ref]&quotSupply-side&quot theorists of the business cycle tend to emphasize the impact of periodic changes in government [ref]tax policies (especially changes in the marginal rates of taxation on various forms of [ref]investment expenditures and business income) as the major precipitant of booms and busts. \[See also: [ref]depression , [ref]inflation , [ref]political business cycle \] 

Cabinet
  A select group of state officials who each head one or more of the principal [ref]bureaucratic departments or agencies of the executive branch of government and who meet as a group from time to time for the purpose of discussing current policy proposals and advising the chief executive of their recommendations. (Chief executives usually also maintain one or more additional advisory councils that may well be more influential than the more formal cabinet.) \[See also: bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics\]

Capital
  The existing stock of goods which are to be used in the production of other goods or services and which have themselves been produced by previous human activities. Capital is conventionally subdivided into &quot;fixed capital&quot; and &quot;circulating capital,&quot; although the distinction is mainly a matter of degree of durability rather than a clear-cut difference in kind. Fixed capital refers to durable producers' goods such as buildings, plant and machinery, while circulating capital refers to stockpiles of materials, semi-finished goods, and components that are normally used up very rapidly in production. Notice that &quot;capital&quot; in the strictest economic sense refers only to real, physical means of production already in being, not to the sums of money put aside through savings to purchase real capital with in the future (although the total amount of capital in a particular firm may for convenience be described or summarized in monetary terms by the potential resale values of all the separate items of capital added together in one grand sum). \[See also: investment, human capital\]

Capitalism
  A form of economic order characterized by private ownership of the means of production and the freedom of private owners to use, buy and sell their property or services on the market at voluntarily agreed prices and terms, with only minimal interference with such transactions by the state or other authoritative third parties. \[See also: market, market economy, communism\]

Captured agency
  A government agency, especially a regulatory agency, that is largely under the influence of the economic interest group(s) most directly and massively affected by its decisions and policies -- typically business firms (and sometimes professional associations, labor unions, or other special interest groups) from the industry or economic sector being regulated. A captured agency shapes its regulations and policies primarily to benefit these favored client groups at the expense of less organized and often less influential groups (such as consumers) rather than designs them in accordance with some broader or more inclusive conception of the public interest. \[See also: bureaucracy , bureaucratic politics , elite (elitist) theory , pluralist theory \]

Cartel
  A formal organization set up by a group of firms that produce and sell the same product for the purpose of exacting and sharing monopolistic rents. The intended purpose of a cartel is to reap monopoly profits by artificially restricting output and thus driving the price above the level that would prevail if they remained in competition with one another. This they normally accomplish by agreeing on a relatively high common asking price for their product that none of the member firms will be permitted underbid, but sometimes the member firms may simply agree to divide the market geographically and grant each other local monopolies without necessarily enforcing a uniform price structure. Since exceptionally high rates of profit in an industry normally would attract ambitious outside firms to make new investments to enter the industry and gain market share by cutting prices, a successful cartel must somehow secure the cooperation of all the significant producers in the industry. It also must find some way to exclude non-cartel firms from selling to customers within the cartel's market area(s) -- such as by getting their national or local governments to grant cartel members a legal monopoly or to enact administrative or tax barriers to sales of the product by outsiders. Since the essence of the cartel's strategy is to restrict the total production of their product below the levels the member firms would produce if left to themselves (that is, to produce at levels where the marginal cost of production is well below the price per unit), the cartel must also work out some mutually acceptable formula for assigning maximum production quotas to each firm in the cartel and then find some way to enforce the output quotas against firms that might want to grab a larger share of the profits by producing at higher levels. (Lower cost producers in the industry generally would be able to make even larger profits by cutting prices and expanding their market share than by cooperating with the cartel.) If the cartel agreement were a legally enforceable contract, then the government and the court system could be counted upon to do the enforcement job for the cartel, and in many fascist and authoritarian countries (as well as a few present day democracies with recent histories of authoritarian government) this has in fact historically been a general practice. However, in the United States, Great Britain and most other advanced democratic capitalist states, cartel agreements are normally either unenforceable in the courts or are held to be positively illegal as &quot;restraints on trade&quot; that are contrary to the public interest because of their adverse effects on consumers. Even in those countries that outlaw private cartels, however, it has often been possible for politically powerful but economically endangered high cost producer firms in a few industries to secure the &quot;cartelization&quot; of their industry in a back-door fashion. Under the guise of establishing a government regulatory regime that allegedly will protect the interests of the consumer through establishing price controls, assigning exclusive market areas to prevent &quot;cut-throat competition,&quot; and excluding &quot;unqualified&quot; competitors by restrictive licensing requirements, independent regulatory commissions in fact have often functioned mainly to serve the economic interests of the dominant high-cost firms in the industry being regulated. \[See also: captured agency, monopoly, competition\]

Ceteris paribus
  Latin expression for &quot;other things being equal.&quot; The term is used in economic analysis when the analyst wants to focus on explaining the effect of changes in one (independent) variable on changes in another (dependent) variable without having to worry about the possible offsetting effects of still other independent variables on the dependent variable under examination. For example, &quot; an increase in the price of beef will result, ceteris paribus, in less beef being sold to consumers.&quot; \[Putting aside the possibility that the prices of chicken, pork, fish and lamb simultaneously increased by even larger percentages, or that consumer incomes have also jumped sharply, or that CBS News has just announced that beef prevents AIDS, etc. -- an increase in the price of beef will result in less beef being sold to consumers.

Checks and balances
  A fundamental principle undergirding the design of American government is that of the separation of powers, which prescribes the parcelling out of the various powers and functions of government to separate and relatively independent levels and branches of the federal system in order to prevent their all being controlled at the same time by any potentially tyrannical political faction. But, to the way of thinking of the Framers of the Constitution, the long-term survival of free popular government would require more than simply a purely formalistic separation of governmental functions and powers into completely independent organizational jurisdictions. Ambitious and unscrupulous office holders in one or another of the various branches and levels of government could be expected to encroach upon the powers and authority of the other branches and levels from time to time, and this would gradually bring about a tyrranical concentration of powers unless the leaders in the other parts of the government could be given the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist the encroachments of the others. &quotAmbition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man \[the officeholder\] must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place.&quot From this the Framers concluded there was a need for the Constitution to include a built-in set of &quotchecks and balances&quot -- the necessary legal weaponry for each branch to defend itself against encroachments on its independence and authority by the others. In most cases, this contervailing power is purely negative, usually taking the form of some special constitutional grant of authority for one branch to say &quotno&quot to at least some of the specific decisions of the other branches in their own fields of specialization and then make it stick. (Some examples: The two houses of Congress may finally agree on a compromise to pass or repeal a law, but the President can veto it. President and Congress can agree on passing a law, but if the federal judiciary declares it to be unconstitutional the courts will refuse to treat the law as valid or enforceable. The courts can issue orders and injunctions for particular individuals to act or refrain from acting in particular ways, including public officials, but the power of the law enforcement agencies in the executive branch is needed to enforce them if the individuals in question decide to disobey. The Congress cannot control the way a judge will rule in a particular case before him, but Congress has the power to define and redefine the jurisdiction of the various federal courts. The President has general supervision of the conduct of foreign policy and military policy, but his treaties must be ratified by the Senate before they enter into force, and only Congress can appropriate public money to pay for such things as the raising of an army or the dispensing of foreign aid.)

Checks and balances (Cont.)
Checks and balances - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Under the system of checks and balances, each branch has primary authority to decide on certain kinds of issues, yet each branch often requires at least minimal voluntary cooperation from the other branches if its decisions and initiatives are to be successfully implemented. Since officeholders are assumed to be ambitious and jealous of their authority, policy cooperation and coordination across the various branches and levels of government can only be the product of hard bargaining and mutually acceptable delineation of authority -- therefore hopefully sustaining the constitutional separation of powers through maintaining a practical balance of power among rival powerholders. And since by virtue of the differing compositions of their constituencies the leading officeholders tend to be responsive to somewhat differing interest groups within society, the need for negotiated compromises among the various branches and levels of government in order to implement policy may also translate into a policy-making process that takes seriously into account the interests of many minorities along with those of majorities. Criticisms of the separation of powers and checks and balances concepts point out that such arrangements make policy making more cumbersome and time consuming than it needs to be and that in fact it can result easily in a deadlock in which government is unable to take any action at all. Moreover, it is also said to be undemocratic, in that it places barriers to the absolute power of the majority to determine public policy by imposing on majorities the need to bargain with (and make concessions to) minorities that have managed to gain disproportionate influence on one or another branch or level of the federal system of multiple governmental institutions. For these reasons, political thinkers who see government as the primary instrumentality for the community to successfully combat or adjust to an on-going series of emergencies that have no other possible remedy tend to be very suspicious of such decentralized power arrangements. On the other hand, political thinkers that see society and the economy as largely self-regulating organisms that need relatively little in the way of new policy initiatives from government for their successful functioning tend to take a more favorable view of checks and balances. \[See also: [ref]separation of powers, [ref]veto, [ref]judicial review, [ref]appropriation, [ref]authorization, [ref]interest group, [ref]pluralist theory\] 

Civil rights, civil liberties
civil liberties
civil rights
Civil rights/civil liberties
  The rights of every citizen to freedom of thought, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom to enjoy privacy and autonomy in the management of one's personal affairs, freedom of private individuals to associate voluntarily and to form organizations for pursuing common purposes, and freedom to participate politically in ways that do not infringe upon the similar rights of others. Although the two terms overlap considerably in ordinary usage (and are often difficult to distinguish in concrete instances), the term civil liberties generally refers more specifically to the protection of the individual's rights to form and express his or her own preferences or convictions and to act freely upon them in the private sphere without undue or intrusive interference by the government, while the term civil rights emphasizes more specifically the individual's rights as a citizen to participate freely and equally in politics and public affairs in order actively to promote his/her preferred public policy alternatives through lobbying policy-makers and/or through personal participation in the electoral process. Thus, civil liberties may be seen as the logical correlates of the goal of limited government, while civil rights are the logical correlates of the goal of popular or [ref]democratic government. \[See also: democracy , liberalism , libertarianism \]

Commerce clause
  The provision of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 8, paragraph 3) that gives Congress the authority to regulate trade with foreign nations and among the states.

Common law
  Legally binding rules or principles of justice developed in the course of history from the gradual accumulation of rulings by judges in individual cases, as differentiated from the kind of statute law embodied in special legal codes or statutes enacted by legislative assemblies or imposed by executive decrees. The importance of the common law heritage is particularly great in the legal systems of Great Britain and of most former British colonies, including the U.S. \[See also: tort, contract, property rights\]

Communism
  Any ideology based on the communal ownership of all property and a classless social structure, with economic production and distribution to be directed and regulated by means of an authoritative economic plan that supposedly embodies the interests of the community as a whole. Karl Marx is today the most famous early theoretician of communism, but he did not invent the term or the basic social ideals, which he mostly borrowed and adapted from the less systematic theories of earlier French utopian socialists -- grafting these onto a philosophical framework Marx derived from the German philosophers Hegel and Feuerbach, while adding in a number of economic theories derived from his reinterpretation of the writings of such early political economists such as Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo. In most versions of the communist utopia, everyone would be expected to co-operate enthusiastically in the process of production, but the individual citizen's equal rights of access to consumer goods would be completely unaffected by his/her own individual contribution to production -- hence Karl Marx's famous slogan &quot;From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.&quot; The Marxian and other 19th century communist utopias also were expected to dispense with such &quot;relics of the past&quot; as trading, money, prices, wages, profits, interest, land-rent, calculations of profit and loss, contracts, banking, insurance, lawsuits, etc. It was expected that such a radical reordering of the economic sphere of life would also more or less rapidly lead to the elimination of all other major social problems such as class conflict, political oppression, racial discrimination, the inequality of the sexes, religious bigotry, and cultural backwardness -- as well as put an end to such more &quot;psychological&quot; forms of suffering as alienation, anomie, and feelings of powerlessness. The specifically Marxist-Leninist variant of socialism which emphasizes that a truly communist society can be achieved only through the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; that is to prepare the way for the future idealized society of communism under the authoritarian guidance of a hierarchical and disciplined Communist Party. A world-wide revolutionary political movement inspired by the October Revolution (Red Oktober) in Russia in 1917 and advocating the establishment everywhere of political, economic, and social institutions and policies modeled on those of the Soviet Union (or, in some later versions, China or Albania) as a means for eventually attaining a communist society. \[See also: capitalism, socialism, ideology, egalitarianism\]

Comparative advantage
  The ability of one economic actor (an individual, a household, a firm, a country, etc.) to produce some particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than other economic actors can. That is, the economic actor with a comparative advantage can produce the particular good or service by giving up less value in other goods or services that he could otherwise produce with his labor and resources than the other economic actors would have to give up in producing that same good or service. This perhaps can be made clearer by a hypothetical example: Suppose both individual A and individual B are able to produce two valuable goods called &quotwidgets&quot and &quotwhatsits.&quot For Mr. A, producing one widget requires ten hours of labor and producing one whatsit requires thirty hours of labor. For Mr. B, producing one widget requires five hours of labor and producing one whatsit requires ten hours of labor. (To keep the example simple, let us assume that both Mr. A and Mr. B each use up precisely the same amount of capital and materials when they are making the same product.) Since every hour of labor devoted to making widgets is an hour that cannot be used for making whatsits, and since there are only so many hours of working time available per month, both Mr. A and Mr. B face trade-offs in allocating their working time between the two possible activities: making more widgets means making fewer whatsits and vice versa. But the precise numerical trade-offs the two face are different. For Mr. A, every additional whatsit he produces &quotcosts&quot him the three widgets he could otherwise have made in the necessary thirty hours. For Mr. B, every additional whatsit he produces &quotcosts&quot him the two widgets he could otherwise have made in the necessary ten hours of labor. Because Mr. B only has to give up two widgets per whatsit, while Mr. A has to give up three widgets per whatsit, Mr. B is said to have a &quotcomparative advantage&quot in whatsit making. (By the same token, Mr. A has a &quotcomparative advantage&quot in widget making, since he only gives up 1/3 of a whatsit for every widget he makes, whereas Mr. B gives up 1/2 of a whatsit for each widget.) Note that an economic actor can display a comparative advantage in the production of a particular good even when the other actor happens to have an absolute advantage in producing the same good. In our particular example, Mr. B is evidently much more efficient in making both products than Mr. A is. (In any given period of time, Mr. B can produce twice as many widgets or three times as many whatsits as Mr. A can.) Thus Mr. B has an [ref]absolute advantage in making both products, but Mr. A nevertheless still has a comparative advantage in widget making. This is because any actor's comparative advantage depends only upon the relationship between that single actor's own levels of productivity for two goods under consideration, while [ref]absolute advantage depends only upon the relationship between two actors' levels of productivity for the same single good under consideration. [ref]More... 

Comparative advantage (Cont.)
Comparative advantage - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The distinction between comparative and absolute advantage is important because it is comparative advantage (and not absolute advantage) that determines the amount of the potential gains in output from specialization and trade between the two actors. And this leads us to the Principle of Specialization According to Comparative Advantage: Total production of goods will be increased if each economic actor devotes more of his scarce resources to producing the good(s) in which he has a comparative advantage and less of his scarce resources to producing the good(s) in which he has a comparative disadvantage. In our example, if Mr. A works 180 hours a month producing only widgets (the area of his comparative advantage), he can produce 18 widgets. If Mr. B works 180 hours a month producing only whatsits, he can produce 18 whatsits. If the two actors can agree to trade goods at any exchange ratio (&quotprice&quot) that is somewhere between the (different) opportunity cost ratios of the two actors \[in our example, anything between two whatsits per widget and three whatsits per widget\], then both actors will be able to have more of both goods (&quotbe better off&quot) with specialization than would be possible without specialization, even if one actor has an absolute advantage over the other in production of both goods. Mr. A will not voluntarily plan to trade away any of his widgets for less than 1/3 of a whatsit each because he can make the whatsits himself at that price, but he will come out ahead if Mr. B will give him more than 1/3 whatsit per widget. Mr. B will not voluntarily plan to trade away any of his whatsits at a price of more than 1/2 whatsit per widget because he can make widgets for himself at that price, but he will be ahead of the game if Mr. A will swap him at less than 1/2 whatsit per widget. Thus there is plenty of room for the two to bargain out a deal that is beneficial to both. (Through trade, each can have at least the same amount of widgets and whatsits that he would enjoy if each produced both products for his own consumption -- plus the added benefit of the hours saved via specialization, that can be enjoyed either directly in the form of extra leisure time or indirectly by using the hours saved to produce still more of these or other goods.) However, if some kind of legal or illegal coercion (or perhaps extreme moral pressure from public opinion in a very traditional society) is exerted to fix an exchange ratio for the two goods that is not within the bargaining range between the [ref]opportunity cost ratios of the two actors, then either: 1. Trade will not take place at all between them (because one actor would be worse off than if he produced both goods for himself and hence will not voluntarily agree to specialize so as to trade on such terms)2. An &quotexploitive&quot division of labor (such as slavery, serfdom, corvee, etc.) will somehow be imposed involuntarily so as to benefit one actor by assigning him all the gains from specialization and then some, at the expense of worsening the condition of the other &quotinvoluntarily specialized&quot actor.\[See also: [ref]absolute advantage, [ref]division of labor, [ref]specialization, [ref]cost\] 

Competition
  Competition is one of the most important concepts in economics, yet when examined closely, it turns out to be one of the most elusive concepts to nail down in practice. A market in some particular good or service is said by economists to be &quot;competitive&quot; if a substantial number of buyers and sellers trade in the good or service independently and thus no single buyer or seller is so &quot;weighty&quot; in the marketplace as to significantly influence the going price of the good or service by his/her individual decisions about how many units he personally will buy or sell. The practical problems (and disagreements) in assessing whether a particular market is &quot;competitive&quot; or not arise when you look at the real world and try to specify the geographic boundaries of the market and the breadth or narrowness of the definition of the good on which you are focussing. Billy-Bob Motors may have the only Ford dealership in town, giving him a &quot;monopoly&quot; in some very narrow sense -- but local car buyers will be quick to travel to other Ford dealerships in any of a number of other cities or towns if Billy-Bob tries to take advantage of his monopoly by jacking up the price and then word gets around (perhaps through advertising) that there are noticeable advantages in the deals offered on Fords elsewhere. The bigger the price differential and the lower the transportation costs between seemingly distinct market areas, the larger the effective market area really becomes. Similarly, dealerships in Chevrolets, Plymouths, Volkswagens, Toyotas, Nissans, Volvos, Fiats, Hyundais, and Hondas are not selling exactly the same products as Ford dealerships (even Fords come in various models), but they sell very close substitutes for Fords that many buyers will turn to if the price of a new Ford at Billy-Bob's seems out of line. Used car dealers, estate sale auctions, bankruptcy liquidators and ordinary citizens selling their old cars through newspaper ads provide still other sources of supply for slightly less close substitutes for a brand new Ford. Even taxis, bus systems, rent-a-car agencies, subway systems, railroads, tractors, motorcycles, motorscooters, mopeds, bicycles, roller skates, dog-sleds and &quot;shanks' mare&quot; constitute partial substitutes for Ford ownership as a method of getting around from point A to point B and thus have a &quot;competitive&quot; restraining effect on pricing in the local market for Fords (which may be seen as only a part of some much broader market in means of personal transportation). The bottom line -- competitiveness in markets is a matter of degree, and the observer's assessment of the degree of competitiveness in concrete instances will be heavily influenced by the observer's initial assumptions about the geographic extent of the market area and the breadth or narrowness of his definition of the good or class of goods that constitute equivalent products. \[See also: market, monopoly, monopsony, substitute goods\]

Complementary goods
  Two products for which the demand schedules are related to each other so that an increase in the price of the first good will cause a leftward shift of the entire demand schedule for the other good(s) -- that is, less of the second good will now be demanded at any given available price of the second good. (By the same token, a decrease in the price of the first good will result in a rightward shift of the entire demand schedule for the other good(s), so that more of the second good will now be demanded at any given available price for the second good.) This complementarity commonly happens when the two goods tend to be consumed or used together in relatively fixed or standardized proportions in at least some of their important uses. A classic example of complementary consumer goods would be frankfurters and hot dog buns. If a supermarket runs a &quot;special&quot; on hot dog buns, it is predictable that customers will want to buy more frankfurters than they otherwise would at whatever is the posted price of frankfurters -- because the total price of enjoying a frankfurter- on-a-bun sandwich is now lower than before due to the special, leading consumers to consume more of both component products. A classic example of complementary producers goods would be iron ore and coking coal, the two main raw materials for making steel. If the price of iron ore goes up, raising the steel companies' costs for making any given amount of steel, ceteris paribus, they are apt to cut back on the total quantity of steel they choose to produce. But if they decide to produce less steel, they will now need to buy less coal -- and therefore the amount of coal demanded at any given price of coal will be less than before the iron ore price increase. (The same complementarity with iron ore would also be evident with regard to all the other factors of production besides coal that are used in making steel -- such as labor-hours of steel workers, steel making machinery etc. The demand curve for each of them will shift to the left in response to increases in the price of coal or any of their other complementary goods or services.) \[See also: substitute goods, demand schedule, demand\]

Confederation
  A form of government in which the major geographical subdivisions of the country have their own governmental organizations that retain numerous independent rights of policy-making and decision that may not be overridden by the central government, and in which the central government's rights of policy-making and decision are severely restricted. The distinction between a federation and a confederation is not always easy to make, but generally speaking, confederations assign much more limited powers to the central government than do federations -- typically only national defense and foreign relations, plus a few other minor functions. One practical criterion often used as the key to distinguishing federations from confederations is that in the latter the central government does not have direct taxing or enforcement authority over individual citizens but rather must depend upon the regional governments to provide its revenues and give effect to its laws governing individuals. \[See also: state, federation, empire\]

Conservatism
  A general preference for the existing order of society and an opposition to all efforts to bring about rapid or fundamental change in that order. Conservative ideologies characteristically strive to show that existing economic and political inequalities are well justified and that the existing order is about as close as is practically attainable to an ideal order. Conservative ideologies most often base their claims on the teachings of religion and traditional morality and tend to downplay the reliability of purely rational or deductive social theories propounded by secular philosophers, economists, and other social thinkers. The specific content of &quot;conservatism&quot; is highly variable across societies and over time, since the arguments necessary to defend the status quo depend upon what the status quo is in any particular country. Because American political and economic institutions were very heavily influenced by 18th and 19th century liberal thought and because America had essentially no experience of the kind of feudal and aristocratic institutions that persisted for so long in Europe, contemporary American conservatism's content includes a much stronger commitment to free markets, individual rights, and political democracy and much less attachment to hereditary aristocracy and state-support for a particular religion than is characteristic of contemporary European conservatism. In Maddox and Lilie's classification of American political ideologies, a political point of view characterized by relatively high support for activist government intervention to enforce traditional morality or social values coupled with relatively high opposition to activist government when it comes to intervening in economic or business affairs. \[See also: ideology, liberalism, libertarianism, populism\]

Constituent
  A person who is represented politically by a designated government official or officeholder, especially when the official is one that the person represented has the opportunity to participate in selecting through voting or perhaps through other methods of indicating political confidence and support. A Senator's constituency consists of the citizenry who reside within his or her state. The constituency of a Member of the House of Representatives consists of the people who live in his or her district. The constituency of a mayor is all the people residing in the city limits. Although the core meaning of the term has to do with the relationship between the voters and their elected representatives, the term is often expanded somewhat to include other individuals or groups whose interests any official in government (whether elected or not) feels morally obligated (or compelled by the political realities of the situation) to protect or further in the policy-making process. In this extended sense of the term, farmers constitute an important &quot;constituency&quot; for the Secretary of Agriculture, labor unions are an important &quot;constituency&quot; for the Secretary of Labor, small businessmen are an important &quot;constituency&quot; for the head of the Small Business Administration, and veterans organizations are an important &quot;constituency&quot; for the head of the Veteran's Administration.

Contract
  A legally binding agreement between two or more competent parties fixing the precise terms and details for a voluntary exchange of goods or services over which the contracting parties possess property rights. An agreement is a legally enforceable contract if and only if: The agreement must be &quot;mutual&quot; (all parties have the same understanding of the meaning of their agreement -- there is a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;); The agreement must be &quot;voluntary&quot; (none of the parties is agreeing under the influence of violent threats or fraudulent misrepresentation of the facts); There must be actual &quot;consideration&quot; paid (that is, each party must be achieving a benefit by giving up something he controls to get something another party controls in exchange: a simple one-sided promise to give someone else a gratuitous benefit is not a contract); All parties to the agreement must be &quot;competent&quot; (children and the severely mentally impaired or insane are assumed by the courts to be incapable of forming a coherent intent or determining their own best interests, so the courts will not enforce the agreements they make); The substance of the agreement must not be &quot;contrary to public policy&quot; (for example, the U.S. courts will not enforce a contract that requires one or more of the parties to commit a crime, nor will they enforce a contract by which even a legally competent adult voluntarily sells himself into life-long slavery in exchange for, say, a ten million dollar payment to his children). \[See also: property rights, private property rights\]

Conviction
  The judgement of a court that a person charged with a crime is guilty. \[See also: acquittal\]

Corporation
  Also referred to as &quot;limited liability corporation.&quot; A type of legal entity provided for in the laws of most modern economically developed countries that two or more investors may agree to create for the purpose of combining some of their resources and going into business together. Corporations have the status of &quot;artificial legal persons&quot; and thus may own property, make contracts, be held responsible for committing crimes or torts, initiate court actions such as lawsuits, and so on. In the United States, businesses organized as limited liability corporations must indicate their status as such by including the word &quot;Incorporated&quot; (&quot;Inc.&quot;) in the name of the firm. In other countries, the same purpose is served by using the equivalent abbreviations &quot;Ltd.&quot; (Limited) or &quot;S.A.&quot; (Anonymous Society) at the end of the company's name. It is today by far the most widespread and successful form of ownership of business property in all advanced capitalist countries. The key feature of the modern business corporation that sets it apart from simple partnerships and sole proprietorships is that it provides the owners of the business with the important legal protection of &quot;limited liability,&quot; whereas these other forms of business organization generally do not. If a failing business enterprise that is owned as a sole proprietorship or partnership is unable to generate enough money to pay its bills, the personal liability of the owners is unlimited -- that is, the unpaid creditors of the business can take legal action to seize not only any assets directly connected with the business itself but also the personal property of any individual owner as well, up to the full amount of the debt. But if a limited liability corporation goes belly up, the legal claims of the company's creditors normally can extend only to the assets actually owned by the corporation in its own name, and not to the individually-owned property of the company's shareholders. The individual owner's shares in the corporation might become worthless if the business fails, but he or she does not have to worry about the Sheriff showing up to seize the house or the car or the family bank accounts to pay off the rest of what the company's creditors are owed. Protection from personal liability makes it much safer and therefore more attractive for more individuals to use some of their savings to become part-owners of very large business organizations. Without limited liability, even the tiniest investment would put a shareholder's entire remaining fortune at risk. During the Middle Ages and the early years of the Industrial Revolution, the corporate form of ownership for business organizations was generally available only as a very special privilege occasionally awarded by the government to a handfull of royal favorites. But changes in the legal codes of Great Britain, the United States, France and other economically progressive countries during the 19th century removed most of the practical barriers to widespread adoption of the corporate form of ownership. This made it much easier to raise capital for new business enterprises. By allowing for pooling the savings of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of individual investors at manageable levels of risk, the widespread adoption of the corporate form of business ownership made extremely large scale private investment projects practical for the first time in history, thereby contributing greatly to the modern era's historic surge in economic growth that continues up to the present day. \[See also: property rights\]

Cost
  In the widest sense, the measure of the value of what has to be given up in order to achieve a particular objective. In everyday language, people most often use the term rather like an accountant does, as synonymous with the total money outlays actually paid out to achieve the objective, but this is not precisely what economists mean by the term. Economists are concerned with rational decision-making , and the rational decision-maker needs to estimate in advance the full range of consequences of each of the various alternative uses of his time and resources open to him, not just the portion of the costs accounted for by money outlays. For the economist, the true cost of any decision is the value of the next best outcome (of all the other possible outcomes) that is given up because of that decision. Unless otherwise specified, when economists say &quotcost,&quot they mean opportunity cost -- that is, the highest valued alternative that must be sacrificed to attain something or otherwise satisfy a want. For example, the opportunity cost of a spur-of-the-moment decision to go to the movies Tuesday afternoon instead of going in to work is not just the six dollars for the ticket plus the gasoline and wear and tear on the car to get there. It also includes (at least) the four hours' wages not earned, diminished prospects for being promoted at work, and possibly such additional consequences as future hostility from co-workers who had to take up the slack, unpleasant feelings of guilt or shame, and so on. In a more extreme vein, the opportunity cost of committing suicide is not simply the money outlay for the necessary equipment, but rather the value of the total range of future satisfactions one might otherwise be able to achieve. \[See also: transaction costs \]

Coup d'etat
coup d etat
  A quick and decisive extra-legal seizure of governmental power by a relatively small but highly organized group of political or military leaders, typically by means of the unexpected arrest or assassination of the incumbent chief executive and his principal supporters within the government. For the coup to be successful, the rank and file of the police and military have to be willing to take orders from the new government leaders once the coup is accomplished, so typically the organizers of successful coups have previously recruited important military and police commanders to their cause prior to going ahead with it. Most frequently, coups are initiated and led by high-ranking military officers. They are most apt to be successful in countries where both the general population's and the government bureaucracy's ideological dedication to upholding established constitutional procedures is relatively weak and consequently there is little danger of massive civilian resistance or non-cooperation by the rank and file of soldiers and other government employees. \[See also: business cycle , recession , [ref]Gross Domestic Product , deflation \]

Deflation
  The opposite of inflation -- that is, a sustained fall over time in the general level of prices, normally measured by the annual percentage increases or decreases of a weighted index of prices of some large and representative sample of goods and services (both consumers' goods and producers' goods) regularly traded in the particular economy under consideration. Just as very large scale inflations are normally the result of large percentage increases in the money stock, large-scale deflations are normally the consequence of substantial reductions in the available money stock. \[See also: inflation\]

Demand
  The willingness and ability of the people within a market area to purchase particular amounts of a good or service at a variety of alternative prices during a specified time period. \[See also: [ref]law of demand, [ref]demand curve, [ref]demand schedule, [ref]supply\] 

Demand curve
demand curves
  A graphical representation of a demand schedule . Conventionally, the demand curve is usually drawn between axes with price plotted along the vertical axis and number of units of the good or service demanded plotted along the horizontal axis. Where the law of demand applies to the particular market under consideration, the demand curve will slope (either gently or steeply) downwards from left to right. \[See also: demand , law of demand , demand schedule , supply \]

Demand schedule
demand schedules
  A table or listing showing the number of units of a single type of good (or service) that potential purchasers would offer to buy at each of a number of varying prices during some particular time period. Demand schedules may be drawn up to reflect the behavioral propensities of a single unique individual, household, or firm -- or, more frequently encountered in microeconomic analysis, composite demand schedules for the particular good may be derived by adding up all the demand schedules of the large number of individuals, households or firms that are active or potentially active as purchasers in the market under consideration. \[See also: demand , demand curve , law of demand , supply \]

Demand, law of
law of demand
demand
  Other things being held constant, the lower the price of a good (or service), the greater the quantity of it that will be demanded by purchasers at any given time. \[See also: demand curve , demand schedule , demand , law of supply \]

Demerit good
  Sometimes also referred to by the term &quot;merit bad.&quot; A good or service available for purchase on the market that some &quot;outside analyst&quot; regards as intrinsically unhealthy, degrading, or socially damaging for other people to consume, regardless of the consumers' own desires, preferences and values. Examples of commodities often treated as demerit goods include tobacco, alcohol and other psychoactive recreational drugs; gambling devices; culturally taboo food products; sexually explicit art and literature; the services of prostitutes; the teaching of unconventional political, economic or religious doctrines; and the provision of disapproved medical services such as birth control counseling or abortion. With respect to such goods, it is often argued that the individual is not the best judge of his or her own welfare and that the government should therefore intervene in the marketplace to discourage the production, sale and/or consumption of demerit goods. Typical policy measures to accomplish this would include criminalizing the advertising, sale or possession of the good; stringent regulation of the market for the good so as to limit access to the good by particularly vulnerable subgroups of the population; and imposing high taxes on producing or purchasing the good in order to make it much more costly than economically necessary to potential consumers. \[See also: merit good\]

Democracy
  A system of government in which effective political power is vested in the people. In older usage (for example, in the writings of the classical Greek and Roman philosophers or in the Federalist Papers), the term was reserved exclusively for governmental systems in which the populace exercised this power directly through general assemblies or referenda to decide the most important questions of law or policy. In more contemporary usage, the term has been broadened to include also what the American Founding Fathers called a republic -- a governmental system in which the power of the people is normally exercised only indirectly, through freely elected representatives who are supposed to make government decisions according to the popular will, or at least according to the supposed values and interests of the population. \[See also: republic, autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy, state, dictatorship, theocracy\]

Depression
  A cyclical period of serious decline in the national economy, characterized by temporarily decreased levels of business activity across most economic sectors, and consequently by decline in [ref]Gross Domestic Product, relatively higher levels of unemployment, rising numbers of business bankruptcies and (at least in the most severe instances) a falling general price level (deflation). A general business slump of somewhat less severity and shorter duration is typically referred to as a recession. There is no precise dividing line that is generally recognized by economists to distinguish a recession from a depression, and incumbent policy-makers since World War II have almost always resisted describing their contemporaneous economic situation as a depression, preferring the milder sounding term &quot;recession.&quot; The term &quot;recession&quot; has largely replaced the older and more emotion-laden term &quot;depression&quot; in most economic literature as well, except in referring to such catastrophic slumps of the past as &quot;The Great Depression&quot; of the 1930s. In the United States, there is a highly respected private academic research foundation called the National Bureau of Economic Research that is the uncontested leader in the collection and analysis of extremely detailed data measuring multitudinous aspects of business activity. The NBER, after exhaustive research, periodically decrees the definitive dating of the latest periods of decline and recovery in the business cycle -- but unfortunately NBER's procedures are so elaborate and so painstaking that recessions are nearly always clearly over by the time that NBER officially verifies that they have begun. Consequently, the NBER declarations are very useful for historians and economic theory-builders but definitely not for time-pressured policy- makers and journalists. While everyone is waiting for a definitive ruling by the NBER, there is a quick-and-dirty rule of thumb for identifying the onset of recessions that is almost universally employed by professional economists as a first approximation for policy purposes: If inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product (or, alternatively, the closely related measure called Gross National Product) declines for two successive quarters (i.e., six months in a row), a recession has begun, and when inflation-adjusted GDP subsequently rises for two consecutive quarters, the recession has ended and recovery is under way. \[See also: business cycle, recession, [ref]Gross Domestic Product, deflation\]

Derived demand
  The demand for each of the factors of production is often referred to as a &quotderived&quot demand to emphasize the fact that the relationship between the factor's price and the quantity of the factor demanded by firms employing it in production is directly dependent on consumer demand for the final product(s) the factor is used to produce. If for some reason (say, for example, a spontaneous shift in consumer tastes) the demand for men's hats increases (shifts to the right) so that more hats than before can be sold at any given price, then the &quotderived&quot demand for felt used in making hats will also increase (shift to the right) so that felt-makers will be able to sell more felt at any given price. (We would also expect the hat-makers' demand for the labor of hatters and for specialized hat-making machinery to shift to the right in a similar fashion in response to the public's greater demand for hats.) What is the mechanism by which a shift in demand for the final product is translated into a shift in demand for the factors of production used in its manufacture? The key is the change in the price of the final product brought about by the shift in demand for it. If the demand curve for hats shifts to the right and the (upwardly sloping) supply curve remains unchanged, then the equilibrium price and quantity in the hat market will now involve both a somewhat higher price for hats and a somewhat larger quantity of hats being produced and sold to the public. (Because of the price rise, the marginal revenues earned by the manufacturers per additional hat sold will be higher, so consequently their desire to maximize profits will lead them to produce additional hats until the marginal cost for the last hat rises to equal the new higher price.) But producing more hats than before will require more of the relevant factors of production than before, which they will want to purchase from their suppliers, shifting the demand curves for each of the factors to the right. (This increase in demand for the factors in turn will tend to raise the factor prices somewhat and to increase the quantity of them sold, which then affects the factor producers' demand for their own necessary inputs and brings about further price-and-quantity adjustments throughout the economy in an ever-widening ripple effect.) \[See also: factors of production demand demand, law of demand curve demand schedule supply supply, law of supply curve supply schedule marginal analysis \]

Dictatorship
  Government by a single person (or group) whose discretion in using the powers and resources of the state is unrestrained by any fixed legal or constitutional rules and who is (are) in no effective way held responsible to the general population or their elected representatives. \[See also: republic, autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy, state, democracy, theocracy\]

Diminishing returns, law of
law of diminishing returns
diminishing returns
  Sometimes also referred to as the law of variable proportions, this &quotlaw&quot is really a generalization economists make about the nature of technology when it is possible to combine the same factors of production in a number of different proportions to make the same product. The law states: When increasing amounts of one factor of production are employed in production along with a fixed amount of some other production factor, after some point, the resulting increases in output of product become smaller and smaller. (That is, first the marginal returns to successive small increases in the variable factor of production turn down, and then eventually the overall average returns per unit of the variable input start decreasing.) Since the law assumes that the available quantity of at least one factor of production is fixed at a given level and that technological knowledge does not change during the relevant period, the law of diminishing returns normally translates into a statement about the short-run choice of production possibilities facing a firm (since in the longer run it is virtually always possible for the firm to acquire more of the temporarily &quotfixed&quot factor -- building an additional factory building, buying additional land, installing additional machines of the same kind, installing newer and more advanced machinery, and so on.) A simple example of the workings of the law of diminishing returns comes from gardening. A particular twenty by twenty garden plot will produce a certain number of pounds of tomatoes if the gardener just puts in the recommended number of rows and plants per row, waters them appropriately and keeps the weeds pulled. If the gardener varies this approach by adding a pound of fertilizer to the topsoil, but otherwise does everything the same, he can increase the number of pounds of tomatoes the garden plot yields by quite a bit (notice the amount of land is being held fixed or constant). If he adds two pounds of fertilizer (rather than just one), probably he can get still more tomatoes per season, but the increase in tomatoes harvested by going from one pound to two pounds of fertilizer is probably smaller than the increase he gets by going from zero pounds to one (diminishing marginal returns). Applying three pounds of fertilizer may still increase the harvest, but perhaps by only a very little bit over the yields available using just two pounds. Applying four pounds of fertilizer turns out to be overdoing it -- the garden yields fewer tomatoes than applying only three pounds because the plants begin to suffer damage from root-burn. And five pounds of fertilizer turns out to kill nearly all the plants before they even flower. Another similar example of diminishing returns in an industrial setting might be a widget factory that features a certain number of square feet of work space and a certain number of machines inside it. Neither the space available nor the number of machines can be added to without a long delay for construction or installation, but it is possible to adjust the amount of labor on short notice by working more shifts and/or taking on some extra workers per shift. Adding extra man-hours of labor will increase the number of widgets produced, but only within limits. After a certain point, such things as worker fatigue, increasing difficulties in supervising the large work force, more frequent breakdowns by over-utilized machinery, or just plain inefficiency due to overcrowding of the work space begin to take their toll. The marginal returns to each successive increment of labor input get smaller and smaller and ultimately turn negative. [ref]More...

Diminishing returns, law of (Cont.)
Law of diminishing returns - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The law of diminishing returns is significant because it is part of the basis for economists' expectations that a firm's short-run marginal cost curves will slope upward as the number of units of output increases. And this in turn is an important part of the basis for the [ref]law of supply's prediction that the number of units of product that a profit-maximizing firm will wish to sell increases as the price obtainable for that product increases. \[See also: [ref]marginal analysis\] 

Discount rate
  The interest rate that banks pay on loans to them from the Federal Reserve. Banks whose reserves dip below the reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors must take immediate action to make good their shortfall. The Federal Reserve is normally willing to make a short-term loan to a bank in this situation to give the bank a brief period of time to make adjustments in its loan and investment portfolio that will permit it to raise its reserves. (The bank might stop making new loans for a few days while the normal repayment flow on old loans proceeds to top up their cash position. If the situation is truly critical, the bank might even begin calling in some of its loans that it would normally have been willing to renew.) Bankers normally do not like to borrow money from the Fed in this manner, because the interest they must pay to the Fed for such a loan (the discount rate) is normally set high enough to lower the bank's profitability significantly. The Fed uses changes in the discount rate as another tool of monetary policy. Raising the discount rate makes it more expensive to borrow from the Fed, and bankers tend to build up their reserve position further above the minimum percentage legally required, just to be extra sure they will not be put to this unnecessary expense in case their projection of the flow of loan repayments by their customers turns out to be a little on the high side. The more conservative reserve position diminishes the volume of the loans they would otherwise be making, and thus an increase in the discount rate tends to cause a decrease in the [ref]money stock and higher short-term interest rates. In contrast, lowering the discount rate is expansionary. As the cost of borrowing from the Fed to meet a temporary emergency falls, bankers are more likely to reduce their excess reserves to a minimum, extending more loans and thus increasing the money stock and tending to lower interest rates in the short term. \[See also: Federal Reserve System, interest rates, monetary policy, money stock, reserve requirement\]

Division of labor
  The division of a complex production process into a number of simpler tasks, each one of which is undertaken by a different individual who typically (but not necessarily) specializes in one task (or a very few tasks) on a more or less permanent basis. The advantages of division of labor for enhancing human productivity were first extensively analyzed by Adam Smith in his 1776 classic The Wealth of Nations, where he coined the phrase. Whereas Smith's famous analysis of the pin factory emphasized improvements in technical efficiency (the time and physical movement saved by workers no longer having to switch from one operation and set of tools to another), it also took note of the improvements in allocational efficiency made possible by developing and then taking advantage of workers' differing skills and talents according to the (at that time not yet named) principle of comparative advantage. In the broadest sense, the extension of the division of labor is the fundamental feature of a modern or developed economy, in which gigantic increases in the volume and variety of production have been attained -- but at the cost of massively increasing economic interdependence within larger and larger populations spread over larger and larger geographical areas. In such a complex society, instead of each individual or family attempting to produce all or most of what it consumes, the individual specializes in producing only a few kinds of good or service (or perhaps only small components of a single good or service) and then acquires all other desired goods or services from the production of other specialists by means of mutual exchange (or, in non-market economies, perhaps through coercive or customary transfer). It is worth noting that, while economists tend to emphasize the immense production- and efficiency-enhancing effects of a complex, geographically extensive, and highly specialized division of labor and the markedly higher average standard of living it makes possible, anthropologists, sociologists, and social-psychologists (as well as many philosophers, artists and social theorists) tend to focus more on other presumed non-economic side-effects of greater social differentiation that they typically view in a much more negative light -- such as the development of a diminished sense of wholeness or personal authorship that may result in lessened emotional satisfaction from one's work; greater difficulties in generating agreement on moral principles and a sense of social solidarity or &quot;belongingness&quot; when the far-flung members of society live their lives in such varied ways and develop such diverse interests; the insecurity of the individual's social status when people are no longer assigned their place in society but must continually compete with others to retain or improve their own social positions; the loss of the sense of community mastery over one's fate that comes with dependence upon distant and unknown people for the provision of most of one's vital necessities, and so on. Analyzing and critiquing the many consequences of an advanced and highly specialized division of labor is among the central themes in the works of such pioneer modern social theorists as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, Ferdinand Toennies, Henry Maine, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim, to mention only a few, and these same topics still remain central to much of contemporary social thought. \[See: socialism\]. \[See also: specialization, market economy, efficiency\]

Economic decisions Non-economic or life-style decisions.
  It should be noted that the term &quot;ideology&quot; often has a somewhat derogatory flavor, especially in Anglo-American societies, because it often carries the implication that &quot;ideological&quot; thought is unduly biased, dogmatic and distorted, an obstacle rather than an aid in perceiving how the world &quot;really&quot; works. (&quot;You, sir, are an ideologue. I, on the other hand, am a pragmatic man of reason who sees things the way they really are.&quot;) \[See also: anarchism, communism, conservatism, fascism, legitimacy, liberalism, libertarianism, populism, socialism, totalitarianism\]

Economic growth
  See growth theory.

Economics
  The branch of the social sciences concerned primarily with analyzing and explaining human behavior in making decisions about the allocation of scarce resources. Economists study the complex ways in which the following are determined within a society: What goods and services are to be produced (and in what amounts)? By what means are these goods and services to be produced (using what combinations of the various substitutable factors of production)? How are the goods and services that are produced to be distributed among the individual members and groups in the society's population? \[See also: allocation\]

Efficiency
  In an economic sense, the ratio or proportionality between the value of the human end achieved (&quot;benefits&quot; or &quot;satisfactions&quot;) and the value of the scarce resources expended to achieve it (&quot;opportunity costs&quot;). When an economist calls a situation or a practice &quot;inefficient,&quot; he is claiming that we could achieve exactly the same desired goals with the expenditure of fewer scarce resources, or, put another way, that the amount of resources being employed could potentially produce even more of the beneficial results intended than they do. Efficiency simply means making the most we can of the limited resources we have. Notice that &quot;efficiency&quot; in the economist's sense is an inherently evaluative term, not a matter of mere technical or scientific measurement of objective physical quantities, as the term might be used in an engineering context (as for example, the &quot;efficiency&quot; of various kinds of steam engine in transforming heat energy to useful kinetic energy). &quot;Value of&quot; always requires some sort of answer to the question &quot;value to whom.&quot; When we assess the efficiency of any process or social institution or practice, just whose evaluations of the means and the ends are we using? In a well-developed market economy, assessment of economic efficiency makes heavy use of the monetary values placed on the various inputs and the resulting outputs in the open marketplace. The valuations that count are thus the valuations of those who are willing and able to support their preferences by spending their money in the ways that seem to them most likely to maximize their own satisfactions or &quot;utility&quot; based on their own individual tastes and preferences. The evidence that any particular economic resource is being used efficiently is, in the end, the fact that no one finds it &quot;worth his while&quot; to bid up the price and pay more in order to divert it to some other use. The logical and philosophical elaboration of the idea that competitive market systems are highly efficient in a much broader sense even than this is the primary content of Adam Smith's classic work The Wealth of Nations (1776). Indeed the entire subdivision of today's economic science known as &quot;welfare economics&quot; specializes primarily in identifying and analyzing the necessary preconditions for voluntary market interactions to generate socially efficient outcomes (and in examining the possibilities for remedies by deliberate state economic policies where those necessary preconditions may not be fully met).

Egalitarianism
  A social philosophy or ideology placing primary stress on the value of human equality and advocating radical social reforms so as to eliminate all forms of economic, social and political inequality. \[See also: anarchism, socialism, communism\]

Elasticity
  A measure of the degree of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another. For example, the price elasticity of [ref]demand for a particular good is the relative degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded to relatively small changes in its price. On a supply-demand graph drawn as normally presented in textbooks, elasticity of demand can be very roughly assessed simply by eyeballing the steepness of the slope of the demand curve : a very steeply sloping demand curve (that is, almost straight up and down) indicates that a given percentage increase in price will induce only a comparatively smaller percentage decrease in the quantity of the commodity that potential consumers wish to buy (&quotrelatively inelastic demand &quot); while a very gently sloping demand curve shows that a given percentage increase in price will produce a still larger percentage decrease in quantity demanded (&quotrelatively elastic demand &quot). Similarly, price elasticity of [ref]supply measures the degree of proportionality with which the quantity of a commodity offered for sale on the market changes in response to a given change in the going price; income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of consumer demand for a commodity to changes in consumer incomes; and so on. Presumably the term &quotelasticity&quot was originally adopted because it enables us to compare how much several dependent variables &quotstretch&quot in response to the same degree of &quotpulling force&quot from the same independent variable. When a numerical estimate is required for a precise prediction of the consequences of a particular price change for the quantity of a good likely to be traded, elasticity is usually defined by the percentage change in the dependent variable (for example, quantity demanded) divided by the associated percentage change in the independent variable (for example, price). Ignoring the plus or minus sign, an elasticity greater than 1 is referred to as relatively elastic and an elasticity less than 1 is referred to as relatively inelastic. (An elasticity precisely equal to 1 is termed unit elasticity.) For relatively small changes, this is practically equivalent to the calculus expression below that includes the slope of the curve and the values of the independent and dependent variables at the point on the curve in question where elasticity is being assessed: elasticity = (dY/dX) * X/Y where X is the independent variable (price, income, etc.) and Y is the dependent variable (quantity demanded, quantity supplied, etc). (Notice that the presence of X and Y as well as dX and dY in the expression makes the elasticity vary based not only on the general slope of the curve but also based on the particular part of the curve that is under consideration -- the elasticity is not generally identical for each and every segment of a given demand or supply curve .)

Elite (elitist) theory
Elite theory
elitist theory
  The theoretical view held by many social scientists which holds that American politics is best understood through the generalization that nearly all political power is held by a relatively small and wealthy group of people sharing similar values and interests and mostly coming from relatively similar privileged backgrounds. Most of the top leaders in all or nearly all key sectors of society are seen as recruited from this same social group, and elite theorists emphasize the degree to which interlocking corporate and foundation directorates, old school ties and frequent social interaction tend to link together and facilitate coordination between the top leaders in business, government, civic organizations, educational and cultural establishments and the mass media. This &quotpower elite&quot can effectively dictate the main goals (if not always the practical means and details) for all really important government policy making (as well as dominate the activities of the major mass media and educational/cultural organizations in society) by virtue of their control over the economic resources of the major business and financial organizations in the country. Their power is seen as based most fundamentally on their personal economic resources and especially on their positions within the top management of the big corporations, and does not really depend upon their ability to garner mass support through efforts to &quotrepresent&quot the interests of broader social groups. Elitist theoreticians differ somewhat among themselves on such questions as how open the power elite is to &quotnew blood,&quot the exact degree of agreement or disagreement that usually prevails within its ranks, and the degree of genuine concern (or lack thereof) for the broader public welfare that enters into their choices of public policy goals, but all such theorists broadly share the notion that it is these few thousand &quotmovers and shakers&quot who really run the country and determine the basic directions of public policy, certainly not the manipulated and powerless masses of ordinary voters choosing among candidates at election time. \[See also: aristocracy , oligarchy , pluralist theory \]

Empire
  A form of conglomerate state encompassing a geographical area or set of areas containing diverse peoples or ethnic groups and ruled by a single central government authority that is primarily identified with one dominant people or ethnic group. The empire thus consists of an imperial center and one or more colonies or other dependent subunits (provinces, protectorates, etc.) whose governments are subordinate to that of the imperial center. Historically, empires have usually first emerged either as the result of dynastic marriages among the royal families of hereditary absolute monarchies or, even more frequently, by an original &quot;core&quot; state expanding through the conquest and incorporation of territories occupied by other peoples, usually followed by the resettlement of substantial numbers of emigrants from the core population who then constitute a privileged governing elite in the newly acquired territories. An empire differs from such other forms of conglomerate state as a federation or confederation by virtue of the specially privileged political status of the core political unit (and often the entire core ethnic group or race) in contrast to the institutionalized inferior status of the other component governmental units and their native populations.

Entitlement program
entitlement programs
  The kind of government program that provides individuals with personal financial benefits (or sometimes special government-provided goods or services) to which an indefinite (but usually rather large) number of potential beneficiaries have a legal right (enforceable in court, if necessary) whenever they meet eligibility conditions that are specified by the standing law that authorizes the program. The beneficiaries of entitlement programs are normally individual citizens or residents, but sometimes organizations such as business corporations, local governments, or even political parties may have similar special &quotentitlements&quot under certain programs. The most important examples of entitlement programs at the federal level in the United States would include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, most Veterans' Administration programs, federal employee and military retirement plans, unemployment compensation, food stamps, and agricultural price support programs. The existence of entitlement programs is mainly significant from a political economy standpoint because of the very difficult problems they create for Congress's efforts to control the exact size of the budget deficit or surplus through the annual appropriations process. It is often very hard to predict in advance just how many individuals will meet the various entitlement criteria during any given year, so it is therefore difficult to predict what the total costs to the government will be at the time the appropriation bills for the coming fiscal year are being drafted. This makes it even harder for government to smooth out the business cycle or pursue other macroeconomic objectives through an active fiscal policy -- because these objectives require careful pre-planning of the size of the budget deficit or surplus to be run. In the first place, the amount of money that will be required in the coming year to fund an entitlement program is often extremely difficult to predict in advance because the number of people with an entitlement may depend upon the overall condition of the economy at the time. For example, the total amount of unemployment benefits to be paid out will depend upon the changing level of unemployment in the economy as the year wears on. Some very large entitlement programs (including Social Security pensions and government employee retirement programs) have been &quotindexed&quot to inflation , so that the size of the benefit is periodically adjusted according to a fixed formula based on unpredictable changes in the Consumers' Price Index. Perhaps more significantly, the amount of spending on entitlement programs is impossible for the Senate and House Appropriations committees to even attempt to adjust or to control because those committees do not have the jurisdiction to rewrite the laws that specify who gets how much and under what conditions. The various specialized standing committees who do have the jurisdiction to rewrite authorizing legislation each tend to be dominated by members whose political interests lie in expanding their particular entitlement program, not in cutting it back, and the political influence of the organized special interest groups that support the programs tends to be overwhelming on the specialized committees when such proposals arise.

Entitlement program (Cont.)
Entitlement program - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Since the middle 1980s, entitlement programs have accounted for more than half of all federal spending. Taken together with such other almost uncontrollable (in the short run, that is) expenses as interest payments on the national debt and the payment obligations arising from long-term contracts already entered into by the government in past years, entitlement programs leave Congress with no more than about 25% of the annual budget to be scrutinized for possible cutbacks through the regular appropriations process. This very substantially reduces the practicality of trying to counteract the ups and downs of the overall economy through a &quotdiscretionary&quot fiscal policy because so very little of the budget is available for meaningful alteration by the Appropriations and Budget committees on short notice. \[See also: [ref]appropriation bill, [ref]authorization bill\] 

Entrepreneur, entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship
  French term (taken over into English) for &quotenterpriser&quot or &quotone who undertakes.&quot An entrepreneur is a person who detects a previously untapped opportunity to make substantial profits (either by lowering the costs of producing existing good/services or by creating brand new ways for people to satisfy their wants through new products) -- and then takes the initiative in bringing together the necessary factors of production to exploit this opportunity, typically by organizing a new business firm (or perhaps a new subdivision of an existing firm) for the purpose. The new opportunity which the entrepreneur has detected may involve the introduction of a new good or service only recently invented or improved. It might involve introducing some existing good or service into a new market area where it is presently unavailable or deepening the original market by finding and publicizing new ways for new groups of customers to use it. It might involve recognizing the potential of some new production technology for dramatically lowering the costs of production of an existing good or service, making it possible to garner huge sales increases at the expense of much higher cost substitutes that are thereby rendered obsolete and no longer competitive. Entrepreneurs thus serve an important role in enabling the economy to adapt to changing conditions and new possibilities for material improvements by creating new production organizations, and even whole new industries. Because of its essential role in initiating the process of production, entrepreneurship is identified by some economists as a &quotfourth factor of production ,&quot alongside land , [ref]labor and capital . In its essence, entrepreneurship involves looking ahead to foresee future conditions of supply and/or demand that will be quite substantially different from present conditions. Having arrived at a vision of the future based on observation of previously unnoticed trends, tentative theories, recent discoveries and inventions, and a large dose of creative imagination, the entrepreneur differentiates himself from the prophet, the social scientist and the idle dreamer by taking practical action to reallocate costly resources in the present so as to prepare for meeting an expected future demand. However, if the entrepreneur's vision of the future proves to be incorrect, all or part of the resources mobilized to prepare for that future may prove to have been wasted, so there are risks of large losses. The prospect of far above average profitability is normally necessary to attract the necessary resources into an undertaking with such a high possibility of loss. Being the first in the field with an exceptionally good idea may well yield far above average profits because of the possibilities for explosive sales growth and because of especially favorable pricing conditions enjoyed due to the temporary monopoly the firm enjoys until imitators can gear up to enter the marketplace.

Entrepreneur, entrepreneurship (Cont.)
Entrepreneur, entrepreneurship - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The entrepreneur may personally bear all or most of the risk of the new enterprise by using only his own resources and thus becoming the sole owner of the business. Frequently, however, the entrepreneur will organize the business in such a way as to share the risks with others, either by borrowing part of the initial financing from banks or from wealthy passive investors or by selling bonds. The entrepreneur may even give up part of the ownership of the enterprise (and thus part of the claims on future profits) to other partners or share-holders willing to buy their way in after the entrepreneur has developed and explained the basic concepts of the new undertaking. However, such risk-sharing arrangements will normally be structured by the entrepreneur in such a way that the entrepreneur retains an ownership interest larger than his original share of the resources put at risk. In other words, there are financial returns to entrepreneurial creativity above and beyond the returns demanded for pure risk-bearing. Entrepreneurship is something above and beyond risk-bearing or even ownership of the enterprise, even though any or all of these functions may happen to be performed by the same person in individual instances. Because the entrepreneur originated the idea of the business venture and took the lead in mobilizing the human and non-human resources to make it a reality, the entrepreneur often takes on the role of operational management of the new enterprise as well, especially during the lean early years before the basic assumptions of the undertaking have been proved valid in practice. However this need not always be the case, and many highly gifted entrepreneurs in history seem to have been quite remarkably lacking in ordinary managerial ambitions and basic skills. Once the core entrepreneurial function of discerning the new profit opportunity and mobilizing resources to exploit it has been fulfilled, the task of exerting day to day control so that these resources are efficiently employed to meet the owners' planned objectives can well be delegated to professional managers who need not be either entrepreneurs or even share-holders. Even though entrepreneurs frequently become managers, and even though professionally trained managers sometimes become entrepreneurs, the function of entrepreneurship is as separate and distinct from management as it is from ownership and risk-bearing. It is good to keep this in mind, because the term &quotentrepreneur&quot is sometimes applied incorrectly and indiscriminately in ordinary speech to any business owner or high-ranking manager. \[See also: [ref]factor of production\]

Externality
  A situation in which the private costs or benefits to the producers or purchasers of a good or service differs from the total social costs or benefits entailed in its production and consumption. An externality exists whenever one individual's actions affect the well-being of another individual -- whether for the better or for the worse -- in ways that need not be paid for according to the existing definition of property rights in the society. An &quotexternal diseconomy,&quot &quotexternal cost&quot or &quotnegative externality&quot results when part of the cost of producing a good or service is born by a firm or household other than the producer or purchaser. An &quotexternal economy,&quot &quotexternal benefit,&quot or &quotpositive externality&quot results when part of the benefit of producing or consuming a good or service accrues to a firm or household other than that which produces or purchases it. Example: If one neighbor decides to repaint his house and spruce up his yard so he can get a better price when selling it, he also at the same time is slightly improving the market value of other houses in the neighborhood, creating a &quotpositive externality&quot benefitting his neighbors. On the other hand, another neighbor who is a grade-A slob and lets the external appearance of his house run down creates a &quotnegative externality&quot by depressing the attractiveness and thus the market value of the whole neighborhood. Externalities of either the &quotpositive&quot or the &quotnegative&quot sort create a problem for the effective functioning of the market to maximize the total utility of the society. The &quotexternal&quot portions of the costs and benefits of producing a good will not be factored into its supply and demand functions because rational profit-maximizing buyers and sellers do not take into account costs and benefits they do not have to bear. Hence a portion of the costs or benefits will not be reflected in determining the market equilibrium prices and quantities of the good involved. The price of the good or service producing the externality will tend toward equality with the marginal personal cost to the producer and the marginal personal utility to the purchaser, rather than toward equality with the marginal social cost of production and the marginal social utility of consumption. Thus, normal market incentives for the buyer and seller to maximize their personal utilities will lead to the over- or under-production of the commodity in question from the point of view of society as a whole, not the socially optimal level of production. Goods involving a positive externality will be &quotunderproduced&quot from the point of view of society as a whole, while goods involving a negative externality will be &quotoverproduced&quot from the point of view of society as a whole. In our example above, the individual homeowner pays all the cost of sprucing up his home but realizes only part of the benefits created -- so consequently each homeowner will probably not keep his house up as well as he otherwise might if his neighbors could somehow be induced or required to pay him something for their share of the benefits from his labors. Contracts often can be worked out as a means to &quotinternalize&quot potential externalities because the existence of the externality implies there is at least the potential opportunity for mutual gains if the &quotthird party&quot by- standers affected can offer compensation to the buyers or sellers in exchange for adjusting production or consumption levels of the good to a more acceptableble level.

Faction
  A somewhat derogatory term for a group of people banded together to seek some self-serving or &quot;selfish&quot; goal through the political process, with the implication being that they usually hope to do this by riding rough-shod over the rights or legitimate interests of many of their fellow citizens. \[See also: rent-seeking behavior\]

Factors of production
  The scarce resources that are useful not so much for direct and immediate satisfaction of human wants as for producing other goods or services. Economists often find it useful for purposes of theoretical simplification to group the millions of different sorts of factors of production into several very broad categories and then discuss them as though all the items within each category were perfectly substitutable for each other and therefore traded on a single market . The simplest such conventional categorization of the factors of production divides them into land , labor , capital , and sometimes also [ref]entrepreneurship and/or human capital . \[See also: derived demand \]

Fascism
  A class of political [ref]ideologies (and historical political regimes) that takes its name from the movement led by Benito Mussolini that took power in Italy in 1922. Mussolini's ideas and practices directly and indirectly influenced political movements in Germany (especially the Nazi Party), Spain (Franco's Falange Party), France, Argentina, and many other European and non-European countries right up to the present day.The different &quot;fascist&quot; movements and regimes have varied considerably in their specific goals and practices, but they are usually said to be characterized by several common features: Militant nationalism, proclaiming the racial and cultural superiority of the dominant ethnic group and asserting that group's inherent right to a special dominant position over other peoples in both the domestic and the international order The adulation of a single charismatic national leader said to possess near superhuman abilities and to be the truest representation of the ideals of the national culture, whose will should therefore literally be law Emphasis on the absolute necessity of complete national unity, which is said to require a very powerful and disciplined state organization (especially an extensive secret police and censorship apparatus), unlimited by constitutional restrictions or legal requirements and under the absolute domination of the leader and his political movement or party Militant anti-Communism coupled with the belief in an extreme and imminent threat to national security from powerful and determined [ref]Communist forces both inside and outside the country Contempt for democratic socialism, [ref]democratic capitalism, liberalism, and all forms of individualism as weak, degenerate, divisive and ineffective ideologies leading only to mediocrity or national suicide Glorification of physical strength, fanatical personal loyalty to the leader, and general combat-readiness as the ultimate personal virtues A sophisticated apparatus for systematically [ref]propagandizing the population into accepting these values and ideas through skilled manipulation of the mass media, which are totally monopolized by the regime once the movement comes to power A propensity toward pursuing a militaristic and aggressive foreign policy Strict regulation and control of the economy by the regime through some form of corporatist economic planning in which the legal forms of private ownership of industry are nominally preserved but in which both workers and [ref]capitalists are obliged to submit their plans and objectives to the most detailed state regulation and extensive wage and price controls, which are designed to insure the priority of the political leadership's objectives over the private economic interests of the citizenry. Therefore under fascism most of the more important markets are allowed to operate only in a non-competitive, [ref]cartelized, and governmentally &quot;rigged&quot; fashion. \[See also: totalitarianism, propaganda, dictatorship, autocracy\]

Federal Reserve System
Federal Reserve
  The central bank for the United States banking system and the institution that holds the primary responsibility for the making and execution of American monetary policies. Its bank notes circulate today as the United States' everyday paper currency. (Metal coins, however, are issued by the United States Treasury Department, not by the Federal Reserve.) The Federal Reserve System represents an almost unique hybrid or blending of elements of governmental power with elements of private ownership and control. Because the authors of the 1913 legislation that set up the Federal Reserve System felt that it was vital to insulate monetary policy from &quotundue&quot pressure and influence by partisan politicians obsessed with their own short-range re-election prospects, the Federal Reserve was set up along the lines of an independent regulatory commission -- not as just one more agency of the Executive Branch that would be under the direction of the President and supervised closely by Congress. The private banking community was also given a major role in the running of the Federal Reserve System that continues to give banking interests privileged access to the process by which the US government's monetary policy is made. The Federal Reserve System's highest decision-making body is its Board of Governors, which consists of seven members. Members of the Fed's Board of Governors are nominated for their positions by the President of the United States and then must be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate before taking office. The members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors serve very long terms (fourteen years), and, once appointed and confirmed, they may not be removed from office by either President or Congress (except through a cumbersome process of impeachment for serious personal violations of the criminal law). People selected for appointment to the Board of Governors have nearly always been professional bankers, executives of Wall Street brokerage houses, or, occasionally, professional economists. They tend to share many of the relatively conservative political and economic views of the business and professional groups from which they are drawn. Because the President can not fire them from their positions before their fourteen-year terms expire, members of the Board of Governors normally feel relatively free to ignore or oppose the President's opinions when they make U.S. monetary policies. Moreover, even though some members of the Board of Governors perhaps feel an [ref]ideological kinship or sense of political gratitude that might predispose them to support the policy views of the President who appointed them, the terms of the Governors are staggered, so that only one Governor's term expires every two years, making it unlikely that any President would be able to dominate the Board with a majority of his own appointees until near the end of his own second four- year term in office. (However, every four years, the President does at least get the opportunity to designate which one of the seven Governors will serve for the next four years as Chairman of the Board of Governors and exercize &quotmoral leadership&quot as first among equals in the Governors' collective deliberations on monetary policy.) Congressional influence on the Federal Reserves System's monetary policy decisions is also in practice rather limited. The Federal Reserve system generates its own revenues to pay its expenses from fees and interest payments paid to it by the commercial banks it regulates, so Congress lacks the normal leverage it has over other agencies through carrots and sticks brandished during the annual appropriations process.

Federation
  A composite or conglomerate state that consists of several regional governments with a common central government, and in which both regional and central governments each have their own spheres of policy making in which their decisions are normally presumed to be final. The powers of the regional and central governments are almost invariably spelled out in detail in a written constitution, which also normally specifies procedures to be followed for resolving conflicts between the two kinds of government (often by some process of judicial review). Generally in a federation both central and regional governments will possess taxing and enforcement powers over the citizenry and therefore both will maintain their own [ref]bureaucratic and police organizations to carry out these powers. \[See also: state, confederation, empire, bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics\]

Fiscal policy
  That part of government policy which is concerned with raising revenue through [ref]taxation and with deciding on the amounts and purposes of government spending. Keynesian economic theorists believe that government can, and should, regulate the overall pace of activity in the national economy through fiscal policy, principally by deliberately having government borrow to spend more than it takes in (running a budget deficit ) to increase total demand for goods and services in times of high unemployment and economic slowdown (the deficit being created either by cutting [ref]taxes or by increasing spending or both). Similarly, Keynesian theorists would advocate having government spend less than it takes in (running a budget surplus ) to cool down the national economy when too great an expansion of total demand has pushed production to its physical limits and threatens to bring on excessive inflation . \[See also: budget , budget deficit , budget surplus , business cycle , unemployment , investment , recession , tax, taxation \]

Free rider
free riders
  A person who chooses to receive the benefits of a &quotpublic good &quot or a &quotpositive externality &quot without contributing to paying the costs of producing those benefits. \[See also: public goods , externality \]

Free trade
  A legal arrangement or national policy under which the exchange of goods and services across international borders is neither restricted nor subsidized by techniques of government intervention such as import tariffs, import quotas, export subsidies, discriminatory regulations disadvantaging foreign buyers or foreign sellers, trade embargoes, politicbword://l manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates, and the like. From their first origins in the writings of Adam Smith up to the present, the classical and neoclassical schools of economic theory have emphasized the advantages of free trade policies and the disadvantages of protectionism for the improvement of popular living standards and the promotion of overall rates of economic growth. Although the theoretical arguments can and do become extremely detailed and complex, the basic conclusion of classical and contemporary neoclassical economic theory is that the advantages of free international trade represent basically only a special case of the advantages of the free market system in general. Although moving toward free trade may represent very real financial losses for the small minority of companies with the political influence to get themselves protected from foreign competition, these losses are normally much more than counterbalanced by the gains to the great majority of the population. Free trade leaves the country's consumers free to seek out the best bargains they can find by not arbitrarily restricting their ability to choose foreign suppliers when they offer a better deal than their domestic competitors in terms of price and/or quality. This enhances competition and breaks down local [ref]monopolies. Free trade also enhances the profitability of many other local industries by enabling them to shop around for better deals in purchasing their supplies of raw materials and other capital goods and thus helping them to reduce their costs of production. In the most general terms, free trade makes possible a progressive extension of the area within which specialization and the division of labor takes place according to the principle of comparative advantage, producing gains from trade in overall productivity and economic efficiency that result in higher average living standards both at home and abroad.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Gross Domestic Product
GDP
  An estimate of the total money value of all the final goods and services produced in a given one-year period using the factors of production located within a particular country's borders. \[See also: [ref]Gross National Product (GNP) \]

Gross National Product (GNP)
Gross National Product
GNP
  An estimate of the total money value of all the final goods and services produced in a given one-year period by the factors of production owned by a particular country's residents. (&quotFinal&quot goods and services means goods and services sold or otherwise provided to their final consumers -- that is, to avoid double counting, the value of steel sold to GM to make a car is not added separately into the GNP or GDP totals because its value is already included when we add in the final sales price of the car to the customer.) GNP and GDP are very closely related concepts in theory, and in actual practice the numbers tend to be pretty close to each other for most large industrialized countries. The differences between the two measures arise from the facts that there may be foreign-owned companies engaged in production within the country's borders and there may be companies owned by the country's residents that are engaged in production in some other country but provide income to residents. So, for example, when Americans receive more income from their overseas [ref]investments than foreigners receive from their [ref]investments in the United States, American GNP will be somewhat larger than GDP in that year. If Americans receive less income from their overseas [ref]investments than foreigners receive from their US [ref]investments , on the other hand, American GNP will be somewhat smaller than GDP.

Growth theory
  The part of economic theory that seeks to explain (and hopes to predict) the rate at which a country's economy will grow over time. Economic growth is usually measured as the annual percentage rate of growth in one or another of the country's major national income accounting aggregates, such as [ref]Gross National Product or [ref]Gross Domestic Product (almost always with appropriate statistical adjustments to discount the potentially misleading effects of price inflation). Just about any country's economy will show sizable year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in its economic growth rate, but economic growth theorists tend to concentrate their efforts on analyzing and explaining the smaller variations in the longer-term trend or average rate of economic growth over periods of a decade or more. They leave explanation of the shorter-term fluctuations around the longer-term trend to specialists in business cycle theory because investigation has shown that the predominant influences on short-term growth rates seem to differ in important ways from the determinants of an economy's long term average growth performance. It might also be added that the political effects of variations in long range economic growth rates tend to be substantially different from the political effects of the booms and busts of the business cycle. The short term ups and downs of the business cycle have dramatic effects on popular perceptions of the country's economic well-being. In a recession, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people may become unemployed and suffer dramatic declines in their incomes for the duration of the crisis -- usually for a period of somewhere between six months and one-and-a-half years before more normal economic conditions return again. Yet over the long haul, even rather small increases or decreases in the trend rate of economic growth will have much more profound and enduring effects on economic production and hence on the material living standards of the population. As an illustration, consider the following: During the period since the end of World War II (1946 to 1999-I), the growth rate of GDP for the United States (corrected for inflation) has averaged about 3.3% per year. Assuming that the typical undergraduate student reading this text was born in 1979, the growth rate of the US economy over his or her lifetime has averaged a slightly lower 2.7% per year - a difference of &quotonly&quot 0.6 percentage points per year. But if the US had been able to maintain the same average growth rate from 1979 to 1999 that it had enjoyed during 1946 to 1978 (about 3.6%), 1998 GDP would have reached 9.152 trillion 1992 dollars worth of goods and services instead of the 7.552 trillion dollars of production actually achieved. That means that the income of the average American household in 1998 (and every single year thereafter) could have been more than 20% higher than it actually turned out to be if only a way could have been found to prevent this seemingly slight decline in the trend rate of economic growth. And if the US economy had somehow managed to average the slightly higher growth rate of an even 4% for the whole postwar period, the income of the average American household from 1998 on could have been about half again as much over what was (and will later be) at their disposal.

Human capital
  A loose catch-all term for the practical knowledge, acquired skills and learned abilities of an individual that make him or her potentially productive and thus equip him or her to earn income in exchange for labor . The figurative use of the term capital in connection with what would perhaps better be called the &quotquality of labor&quot is somewhat confusing. In the strictest sense of the term, human capital is not really capital at all. The term was coined so as to make a useful illustrative analogy between [ref]investing resources to increase the stock of ordinary physical capital (tools, machines, buildings, etc.) in order to increase the productivity of labor and &quotinvesting&quot in the education or training of the labor force as an alternative means of accomplishing the same general objective of higher productivity. In both sorts of &quotinvestment,&quot [ref]costs are incurred by investors in the present in the expectation of deriving extra benefits over a long period of time in the future. As in the case of ordinary investments in physical capital, investments in human capital make economic sense to the extent that the value of the additional future benefits to be expected (greater productivity and thus more income for the worker and his employer) exceed the extra costs that have to be incurred in the present to obtain them (costs of schooling or training programs, production and income foregone while the individual is in training, the loss of leisure and perhaps the experience of mental anguish undergone by the individual in having to learn new things, etc.). Varying levels of past investment in human capital provides one of the main explanation for the size of wage and salary differentials among individuals: payment for an individual's labor in reality includes not just payment for the employee's leisure time foregone but also a premium that represents the going rate of return on his past investment in human capital. The analogy between human capital and real capital breaks down in one important respect, however. Property rights over ordinary inanimate capital are normally readily transferable by sale from one owner to another, and consequently [ref]markets for capital goods can function easily and smoothly to reallocate such resources from one project to another with minimal complications and transactions costs. The value of resources that have been invested in physical capital by an investor can often be readily recovered later (at least in good part) through resale, with the proceeds being easily redeployed into purchases for consumption or reinvestment in other types of capital goods as the investor may choose. However, human capital is by definition inseparably embedded in the nervous system of a specific individual and it thus cannot be separately owned apart from the individual's living body itself. Except in societies that legalize slavery (or at least enforce very long term transferable indentured labor [ref]contracts ), human capital itself cannot be directly bought and sold on the market -- only its temporary services as reflected in the labor productivity of the one individual who alone can own it. If an employee chooses to quit his or her job (perhaps because of an offer of much higher pay by a competing firm in the same industry), then any past investment the employer may have made to upgrade the employee's job skills is lost to the firm from the minute the former employee walks out the door for the last time. [ref]More...

Human capital (Cont.)
Human capital - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The only person who can invest in human capital with full confidence that he will not be arbitrarily deprived of its fruits in the future without compensation is the individual in whom the investment is made, so other firms or individuals therefore have much less incentive to invest resources in him or her in this way, even if this might be the cheapest way to increase productivity. Even the individual in whom the human capital is to be embedded may be somewhat deterred from investing by the fact that such an investment is necessarily very illiquid -- that he cannot later recoup any part of the value of his own investment in human capital by selling it off if he should desire to go into some other line of endeavor where the skills involved are not useful. \[See also: [ref]factors of production, [ref]labor, [ref]capital\] 

Hyperinflation
  Extremely rapid or &quot;run-away&quot; inflation. The precise boundary line between &quot;ordinary&quot; inflation and hyperinflation is somewhat arbitrary, but contemporary economists generally reserve the term hyperinflation for situations in which the general price level is increasing at rates in excess of 50% per month. \[See also: inflation\]

Ideology
  A comprehensive and coherent set of basic beliefs about political, economic, social and cultural affairs that is held in common by a sizable group of people within a society. Such interrelated ideas and teachings purport both to explain how political, economic, social and cultural institutions really do work and also to prescribe how such institutions ought ideally to operate. [ref]Conservative ideologies seek to demonstrate a close correspondence between &quot;the way things are&quot; and &quot;the way things ought to be,&quot; thus [ref]legitimizing the existing order in the eyes of those who can be convinced to believe in the ideology. Radical and revolutionary ideologies, on the other hand, set unconventional, higher, or even utopian standards with regard to what would constitute a [ref]legitimate and supportable social-economic-political system and then demonstrate in detail that the existing order does not even come close to meeting these standards, thereby [ref]de-legitimizing the existing system and helping mobilize believers in the ideology for concerted action to reform or overthrow the existing order. (In addition to their descriptive and prescriptive functions about existing and ideal social orders, ideologies may also include more specialized doctrines regarding the most suitable political strategies and tactics to be pursued by believers in their efforts to shore up or undermine the existing order.) [ref]One useful way of categorizing ideologies from a political point of view focusses on differences in the ideologies' prescriptions for how much the government ought to be involved in directing or regulating economic, social and cultural affairs and how much individuals or voluntary organizations ought to be left alone to make their own (widely varied) decisions in these spheres of life. In this course, for example, we frequently employ a two-dimensional classification of ideologies proposed by Maddox and Lilie that is based on assessing people's preferences for government regulation versus non-regulation in

Impoundment
  A traditional [ref]budgeting procedure by which the President of the United States once could prevent any agency of the Executive Branch from spending part or all of the money previously appropriated by Congress for their use. He would accomplish this, in essence, by an executive order that would forbid the Treasury to transfer the money in question to the agency's account. (The Constitution provides that no money from the Treasury can be spent without a specific [ref]Congressional appropriation , but it is silent on the question of whether all [ref]money appropriated by Congress actually has to be spent.) All American presidents since John Adams asserted the right to impound [ref]appropriated funds , and presidents often used this as a way of making relatively small cuts in Federal spending on programs that they deemed unwise or unnecessary, despite occasional murmurings of dissatisfaction from Congressmen annoyed by the cancellation or trimming of some of their pet pork-barrel projects . In 1973-1974, however, President Nixon made unusually large-scale use of impoundment in his efforts to fight the unusually serious [ref]inflationary pressures of the time by trimming back the budget deficit . President Nixon impounded nearly $12 billion of [ref]Congressional appropriations , which represented something over 4% of the spending [ref]Congress had appropriated for the coming fiscal year. Congressional leaders, who were already up in arms against the Nixon White House because of the Watergate scandal, rebelled against the implicit presidential rebuke of their judgment and authority over spending decisions posed by such large-scale impoundment. In 1974, Congress passed legislation purporting to make the old practice of presidential impoundment illegal and legally requiring the Executive Branch to spend every last penny that would ever [ref]be appropriated for it by Congress in the future. The administration denied that Congress had the constitutional authority to over-ride the President's control over the executive branch agencies in this manner, but a Federal Court eventually upheld the Congress's position on this matter, and the new Ford Administration chose to acquiesce in this lower court ruling rather than to further antagonize the already hostile Congress with an appeal to the Supreme Court. \[See also: sequestration \]

Incentive
incentives
  Something that provides a motive for a person to choose a particular course of action. Organized cooperative activities in a social setting -- such as cooperation for the purpose of economic production -- depends upon each of the participants having some sort of incentive to behave in the required cooperative fashion. Different societies (and even different organizations within the same society) vary considerably in the nature of the incentive systems upon which they characteristically rely to organize their common projects. Incentives may be classified according to a number of different schemes, but one of the more useful classifications subdivides incentives into three general types: moral incentives, coercive incentives and remunerative incentives. A person has a moral incentive to behave in a particular way when he has been taught to believe that it is the &quotright&quot or &quotproper&quot or &quotadmirable&quot thing to do. If he behaves as others expect him to, he may expect the approval or even the admiration of the other members of the collectivity and enjoy an enhanced sense of acceptance or self-esteem. If he behaves improperly, he may expect verbal expressions of condemnation, scorn, ridicule or even ostracism from the collectivity, and he may experience unpleasant feelings of guilt, shame or self-condemnation. A person has a coercive incentive to behave in a particular way when it has been made known to him that failure to do so will result in some form of physical aggression being directed at him by other members of the collectivity in the form of inflicting pain or physical harm on him or his loved ones, depriving him of his freedom of movement, or perhaps confiscating or destroying his treasured possessions. A person has a remunerative incentive to behave in a particular way if it has been made known to him that doing so will result in some form of material reward he will not otherwise receive. If he behaves as desired, he will receive some specified amount of a valuable good or service (or money with which he can purchase whatever he wishes) in exchange. All known societies employ all three sorts of incentives to at least some degree in order to evoke from its members the necessary degree of cooperation for the society to survive and flourish. However, different societies differ radically in the relative proportions of these different kinds of incentives used within their characteristic mix of incentives. &quotPrimitive&quot or &quottraditional&quot cultures such as those of hunter-gatherers tend to rely very heavily on moral incentives and make relatively little use of coercive and remunerative incentives to sustain social cooperation. More &quotadvanced&quot or &quotmodern&quot societies built around a much more [ref]specialized and complex division of labor tend to make much greater use of both coercive and remunerative incentives in organizing social activities, while still relying in very important ways upon moral or normative incentives. Among the more &quotadvanced&quot societies, liberal societies try to rely as much as possible on remunerative and moral incentives in preference to the use of coercive incentives, while authoritarian and totalitarian societies display much less reluctance to resort to coercive incentives in securing social cooperation. \[See also: division of labor , specialization , ideology , liberalism , totalitarianism , agency problem \]

Incrementalism (incrementalist decision-making)
Incrementalism
incrementalist decision-making
incrementalism
  Because an [ref]exhaustive analysis of the costs and benefits of every conceivable option for dealing with a problem in public policy is often unduly time-consuming and expensive, large organizations (and often individuals) may resort to a practical shortcut in deciding on possible improvements of existing programs. Only a few of the many possible options are seriously examined, and these tend to be ones that involve only small changes in existing policies or procedures rather than radical innovations. Changes are thus made only &quot[ref]at the margin .&quot An example of incrementalism often cited: Congressional budget decision-making in the U.S., where the usual questions considered about a given (existing) agency might typically range from whether to cut 4 or 5 percent from its budget to whether to tack on a 5 or 10% increase. Congress very seldom stops to think seriously about whether the agency ought to be abolished entirely as unnecessary or harmful to the public interest or whether its responsibilities would be better performed in some entirely different manner by another agency. Consequently, one of the best predictors of an agency's budget in a given year is that same agency's budget for the year before plus or minus a small increment representing the rate of growth or shrinkage of total government revenues. \[See also: rational-comprehensive models of decision-making , systems theories of decision-making , bureaucracy , bureaucratic politics \]

Incumbent
  A current office-holder.

Inflation
  In contemporary usage, a sustained rise over time in the general level of prices, normally measured by a weighted index of prices of a large and representative sample of goods and services (both consumers' goods and producers' goods) regularly traded in the economy under consideration. (In 19th century usage, the term referred more specifically to any sustained expansion in the stock of money available within the economy under consideration -- the eventual consequence of which would normally be a generalized increase in prices.) When the quantity of money available in the economy begins to exceed the amount that firms and households (in the aggregate) feel they wish to keep on hand to finance their expected volume of trading in the foreseeable future, people tend to increase their rate of spending all at once, shifting the demand curves for nearly all goods and services to the right at the same time and thus driving up the general price level -- which is just another way of saying that each unit of money begins to be worth less than before in its purchasing power. Such an acceleration of spending may happen for any of a number of reasons

Interest group
  A group of people who share common traits, attitudes, beliefs, and/or objectives who have formed a formal organization to serve specific common interests of the membership. Examples of interest groups would include such disparate organizations as the Auburn Chamber of Commerce, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the elementary school P.T.A., the Teamsters Union, the Southern Baptist Convention, the American Numismatics Association, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Brangus Breeders Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Cosa Nostra, and the Benevolent Order of Elks. Interest groups typically have formal admission to membership, dues, elected officers, by-laws and regular meetings, and they often provide information and regular opportunities for communication through newsletters or magazines, sponsor recreational or educational activities, organize volunteer public service projects, make deals for group discounts or group insurance and so on. Larger interest group organizations may have full-time paid officers or professional staff to manage and to supplement the efforts of member-volunteers in furthering the work of the organization. Many interest groups at least occasionally engage in some form of lobbying or other political activities with respect to issues that touch directly on the common interests that are the organization's reason for being -- for example, the PTA may organize support for a bond issue election to pay for erecting a new school building. Some interest groups have political activity as their principal or only reason for being in the first place. Interest groups that exist primarily for exerting political influence as a means of affecting government policies or legislation are often referred to by the narrower term pressure groups. Since more and more activities have become politicized with the expansion of the scope of activities of the government in the 20th century, more and more interest groups find themselves drawn into politics to protect or promote the interests of their membership, and the distinction in usage between the terms interest group and pressure group has accordingly become less significant in ordinary language. \[See also: pluralist theory\]

Interest rate(s)
Interest rate
Interest rates
interest rate
  The price(s) of obtaining the temporary use of money that one borrows from someone else who actually owns it, normally expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed per year. Since loans and loan repayment extend over considerable periods of time and entail more complex security arrangements than a simple cash-on-the-barrelhead exchange, interest rates to be paid are normally spelled out as part of a relatively complex written contract between borrower and lender. Like most other prices in an advanced market economy, the going levels of interest rates are determined in rather well-developed, highly competitive markets (in this case, they are referred to as &quotcredit markets&quot or &quotfinancial markets&quot) by the interaction and mutual adjustment of supply and demand . The demand for loanable funds mainly comes from firms who need them for investment purposes, from households who want them mainly for the purchase of big-ticket consumer durable goods like houses or autos, and from national, state and local governments who want them in order to make up the difference between the amount of money available in the treasury from tax collections and the (larger) amount of money the government has nevertheless decided to spend in financing its various projects and programs. The supply of loanable funds comes mainly from individual household and business firm savings placed with financial intermediary firms such as banks, thrift institutions, and insurance companies or else mobilized directly from individual lenders through the issuance of bonds, notes and other credit instruments tradeable on financial markets. In economies such as our own that allow fractional reserve banking, a considerable portion of the supply of loanable funds comes through credit creation by the central bank and the banking system. It is a serious oversimplification to refer to &quotthe&quot rate of interest because at any given time there will normally be a whole range of different rates of interest that vary according to (among other things) the particular form of lending (bank [ref]savings deposits, personal i.o.u.'s, secured mortgages, collateralized bank loans, corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes, etc.), the contractual terms upon which the money is loaned (duration of the loan, repayment schedule, fixed rate or floating rate, national currency in which the loan is to be repaid, etc.), and the perceived degree of risk that the particular category of borrower will default on his repayments. For theoretical or analytical purposes, economists often like to postulate the existence of a &quotpure&quot (completely risk free) rate of interest (closely approximated by the rate of return on very short-term U.S. government Treasury bills) and then analyze other real world interest rates in terms of various factors peculiar to particular types of loans that each cause some sort of &quotpremium&quot to be added on to the pure rate of interest in proportion to the various kinds and degrees of risk entailed (risk of default, risk of inflation or currency devaluation reducing the real value of the repayment over time, risk that the debt would be hard to resell if the lender unexpectedly needs to get his money out before the term of the loan expires, etc.) [ref]More ...

Interest rate(s) (Cont.)
Interest rate - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The level of interest rates plays an extremely important role on either the supply side or the demand side of very many other important markets in the economy, and for that reason interest rates are often perceived by government policy makers as a potentially powerful tool for manipulating the economy in the interests of promoting growth, controlling inflation, stimulating exports and so on. Large-scale [ref]investment projects by business firms such as building new factories (or starting up new businesses) are often financed largely by borrowing, and the level of interest rates plays an important role in determining whether a particular [ref]investment project under consideration seems likely to be profitable or not. Thus, a period of very high interest rates (especially very high long-term interest rates) is likely to reduce greatly the amount of new [ref]investment undertaken -- with obvious short-term consequences for the level of employment in the construction and machine-tools industries and with longer-term consequences for the country's overall economic growth in the future. Similarly, the level of interest rates plays a large role in the willingness and ability of consumers to purchase new houses, recreational vehicles, automobiles, refrigerators and other big ticket items -- with important implications for the profitability and level of employment in these industries. Interest rates available on [ref]savings accounts, bonds, and the like play a role in determining household decisions about how much income to save and how much to spend on immediate consumption. Interest rates (and especially their relationship to the levels of interest rates in other countries) also play a crucial role in affecting the volume of [ref]savings entering the country from abroad for local [ref]investment or leaving the country for foreign [ref]investment purposes -- thus influencing not only [ref]investment activity but also the exchange rates of the domestic currency in relation to foreign currencies, and thus the attractiveness of the country's exports to potential purchasers abroad. For all these reasons (and others), governments in the 20th century are nearly always deeply involved in deliberate efforts to influence interest rates by means of monetary policies that encourage the expansion (or, occasionally, contraction) of the [ref]money stock through regulatory pressures on the [ref]banking system. \[See also: [ref]monetary policy , [ref]banking , [ref]supply, law of , [ref]demand, law of \] 

Investment
  All income expended by firms or government agencies on capital goods for use in their productive activities. Thus aggregate investment in a national economy is the total amount of spending in order to maintain or increase the stock of physical goods not intended for immediate consumption by the purchasing entity but rather for use in producing other kinds of goods or services to be delivered to others. (Note that the economist's sense of the term is somewhat narrower than the general population's use of the term, in that the economist would exclude the purchase of purely financial paper assets like bonds or shares of stock from coverage by the term &quot;investment&quot;.) All forms of investment thus require prior saving from income, but not all savings are for the purpose of investment. \[See also: savings, capital, interest rates, derived demand\]

Iron triangles
  The closed, mutually supportive relationships that often prevail in the United States between the government agencies, the special interest lobbying organizations, and the legislative committees or subcommittees with jurisdiction over a particular functional area of government policy. As long as they hang together, the members of these small groups of movers and shakers tend to dominate all policy-making in their respective specialized areas of concern, and they tend to present a united front against &quotoutsiders&quot who attempt to invade their turf and alter established policies that have been worked out by years of private negotiations among the &quotinsiders.&quot The middle-level bureaucrats who run the agencies may use their special friends in Congress to block the efforts of a new President or a new Congressional majority leadership bent on reforming or reducing the size of their agencies. The Congressmen and Senators on the oversight committees can count upon their friends in the agencies to continue &quotpet&quot programs and pork-barrel projects important to their local constituencies or even to do special favors for their political supporters and financial backers. Lobbying organizations provide useful information to the committees and the agencies, provide campaign support for the relevant Congressmen, and often help to mobilize public opinion in favor of larger appropriations and expanded programs for &quottheir&quot part of the government bureaucracy. In return, they tend to be consulted and carefully placated when new laws or administrative regulations or important appointments affecting their special interests are being made. These triangles are said to be &quotstrong as iron&quot in that these mutually supportive relationships are often so politically powerful that representatives of the more general interests of society are usually effectively prevented from &quotinterfering&quot with policy-making altogether whenever their concept of the general interest runs counter to the special interests of the entrenched interest groups, bureaucrats and politicians. \[See also: bureaucracy , bureaucratic politics , captured agency , interest group , logrolling , pluralist theory , pork-barrel legislation \]

Judicial activism
  The view that the Supreme Court justices (and even other lower-ranking judges as well) can and should creatively (re)interpret the texts of the Constitution and the laws in order to serve the judges' own considered estimates of the vital needs of contemporary society when the elected &quot;political&quot; branches of the Federal government and/or the various state governments seem to them to be failing to meet these needs. On such a view, judges should not hesitate to go beyond their traditional role as interpreters of the Constitution and laws given to them by others in order to assume a role as independent policy makers or independent &quot;trustees&quot; on behalf of society. \[See also: judicial restraint, judicial review\]

Judicial restraint
  The view that the Supreme Court (and other lesser courts) should not read the judges' own philosophies or policy preferences into the constitution and laws and should whenever reasonably possible construe the law so as to avoid second guessing the policy decisions made by other governmental institutions such as Congress, the President and state governments within their constitutional spheres of authority. On such a view, judges have no popular mandate to act as policy makers and should defer to the decisions of the elected &quot;political&quot; branches of the Federal government and of the states in matters of policy making so long as these policymakers stay within the limits of their powers as defined by the US Constitution and the constitutions of the several states. \[See also: judicial activism, judicial review\]

Judicial review
  The power of the federal courts to overturn or limit the enforcement of Federal or state laws or regulations that the judges determine have violated the Federal constitution. The term also covers the power of the Federal courts to overturn or limit the enforcement of state laws or regulations that the judges determine are in direct conflict with Federal laws or regulations regarding a specific subject matter where the Federal constitution gives primary jurisdiction to the Federal government. Also the power of state courts to overturn or limit the enforcement of state laws or regulations that the judges determine have violated either the Federal constitution or the constitution of their own state. \[See also: judicial activism, judicial restraint, separation of powers, checks and balances\]

Labor
  The collective or generic name given to all the various productive services provided by human beings, including physical effort, skills, intellectual abilities and applied knowledge. Although a market society with a complex division of labor involves hundreds or even many thousands of discrete types of labor differentiated according to the kinds of skills and abilities required (each with their own separate but interconnected labor markets), economists often find it useful for theorizing to simplify the real situation by speaking as though there was only one homogeneous kind of labor to be considered, with this single factor of production being freely and easily substitutable across all different alternative production processes for all different sorts of goods and services. When economists moving beyond such very simple models of the economy want to recognize the reality that acquiring specialized labor skills involves a process of specialized learning that is often very costly and time-consuming, they are apt to refer (somewhat contradictorily and confusingly) to &quot;investment in human capital&quot; and treat the individual's process of decision-making in deciding what sorts of training to pursue according to a marginal costs of production and marginal revenues logic analogous to firms' decision-making processes in choosing to invest in [ref]physical capital. \[See also: human capital, fiscal policy, factors of production, marginal analysis, unemployment, productivity\]

Laissez-faire
  Literally, French for &quot;Let do.&quot; The classical liberal (and modern libertarian) doctrine that the economic affairs of society are best guided by the free and autonomous decisions of individuals in the marketplace, to the near exclusion of government interference in economic matters. That is, the doctrine that government should almost always leave people alone and let them do as they please, so long as they respect the personal and property rights of others. \[See also: liberalism, libertarianism\]

Land
  Generalized economists' term or label to cover all those factors of production that are still in their raw state (or nearly so) -- that is, that have not yet been worked on or transformed by human labor \[See: human capital\]. Thus, &quot;land&quot; in the economists' sense means not only the dry portion of the earth's surface, but also all those natural resources such as mineral deposits, wild plants and animals, soil fertility, surface water, solar energy and the bounty of the seas that can be used in production. \[See also: factors of production, rent, resources\]

Left-wing, leftist
leftist
left-wing
  General descriptive terms for any of several otherwise quite varied political ideologies (socialism , communism , social democracy, welfare statism , contemporary American liberalism , some versions of anarchism , etc.) that join in [ref]denouncing the extent of economic and social inequality in the present order of society and advocate the adoption of vigorous public policies to reduce or eliminate these inequalities, usually through some combination of the following: Reduction or elimination of legal protections for private property rights Greater regulation (or complete expropriation) of private economic activity Stringent limitations on the right to inherit wealth Higher tax burdens on the rich and the middle-class, and/or the provision of more tax-supported government services and money payments to the poor. In America, the term has a somewhat more derogatory flavor than in European usage. \[See also: right-wing , ideology , legitimacy , socialism , communism , anarchism , liberalism , welfare state \]

Legitimacy
  The principle that indicates the acceptance of the decisions of government leaders and officials by (most of) the public on the grounds that these leaders' acquisition and exercise of power has been in accordance with the society's generally accepted procedures and political or moral values. Legitimacy may be conferred upon power holders in a variety of ways in different societies, usually involving solemn formal rituals of a religious or quasi-religious nature -- royal birth and coronation in monarchies, popular election and &quot;swearing in&quot; in democracies and so on. &quot;Legitimate&quot; rulers typically require less use of physical coercion to enforce their decisions than rulers lacking in legitimacy, because most of the people are apt to feel a moral obligation to obey the former but not the latter. Consequently, people who gain or hold power by illegitimate means tend to work very hard to discover or create ways of endowing themselves with legitimacy after the fact, often by inventing a new ideology or religion and attempting to indoctrinate the people with its legitimating formulas through various forms of propaganda, thus creating moral incentives for the citizenry to obey their government. \[See also: ideology, propaganda, state\]

Liberalism
liberal
  A 19th century political viewpoint or ideology associated with strong support for a broad interpretation of civil liberties for freedom of expression and religious toleration, for widespread popular participation in the political process, and for the repeal of protectionist legal restrictions inhibiting the operation of a capitalist free market economy. In the 20th century US, the term has come to describe an ideology with similar views on civil liberties and personal freedom issues but now supporting a much stronger role for government in regulating and manipulating the private economy and providing public support for the economically and socially disadvantaged, though still stopping well short of full socialism . In Europe, the term liberalism is still used more in its 19th century sense, and European liberals are rather more respectful of the values of the free market than their American namesakes, whose views sometimes more closely resemble those of Europeans styling themselves as social democrats . \[See also: ideology , libertarianism , socialism , welfare state \]

Libertarianism
libertarian
  A contemporary 20th century political viewpoint or ideology derived largely from 19th century liberalism , holding that any [ref]legitimate government should be small and should play only the most minimal possible role in economic, social and cultural life, with social relationships to be regulated as much as possible by voluntary [ref]contracts and generally accepted custom and as little as possible by statute law. In other words, libertarians believe that the individual should be as free as is practically feasible from government restraint and regulation in both the economic and non-economic aspects of life. Thus, libertarians endorse stricter respect for private property rights , the establishment of a more laissez-faire laissez-faire capitalist economic system, rigorous separation of church and state, and greater respect for individual rights to freedom of expression and freedom of choice in personal lifestyles. They oppose government programs for the redistribution of income, the inculcation of &quotpolitically correct&quot values through government schools and propaganda outlets, all forms of government-imposed censorship, the imposition of criminal penalties for the commission of &quotvictimless crimes,&quot and in general all forms of social, economic or cultural &quotengineering&quot by the government. \[See also: ideology civil rights/civil liberties , property rights liberalism , laissez-faire \]

Limited liability
  See corporation.

Line-item veto
  A special form of veto in which the chief executive has the right to prevent particular provisions of a bill enacted by a legislative assembly from becoming law without having to kill all the other parts of the bill at the same time. Many state governors in the United States have line-item veto power with respect to at least some kinds of legislative enactment. Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton have all endorsed the idea of granting the President line-item veto powers over appropriations bills as a means of controlling the budget deficit problem, but the President of the United States has only recently acquired a very limited line-item veto power through certain changes in the rules of the House of Representatives and Senate. In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that even this limited form of line-item veto enacted by a simple Congressional majority was unconstitutional. Most Congressmen and Senators seem reluctant to approve a constitutional amendment to provide for a permanent line-item veto for the President because this power would enable him more easily to veto [ref]pork barrel projects or other special interest legislation that they have traditionally added into more urgent omnibus appropriations bills through skillful log-rolling -- thus giving the President additional power to punish severely those members of Congress who have in some way opposed or displeased the President and potentially upsetting the current balance of power between the Executive and Legislative branches of the Federal government. \[See also: veto , separation of powers , checks and balances , appropriations , logrolling , pork-barrel legislation \]

Logrolling
  A practice common in the U.S. Congress and in many other legislative assemblies in which two (or more) legislators agree for each to trade his vote on one bill he cares little about in exchange for the other's vote on a bill that is personally much more important to him. Logrolling is especially common when the legislators are relatively free of control by their national party leaders and are trying to secure votes for bills that will concentrate sizable benefits on their own home districts while spreading most of the costs out over taxpayers in the rest of the country. Local projects such as Federally funded dams, bridges, highways, housing projects, VA hospitals, job-training centers, military bases and the like are often pushed through by logrolling. \[See also: pork-barrel legislation , appropriation bill , authorization boll \]

Macroeconomics
macroeconomic theories
macroeconomics
macroeconomic
  The subdivision of the discipline of economics that studies and strives to explain the functioning of the economy as a whole -- the total output of the economy, the overall level of employment or unemployment , movements in the average level of prices (inflation or deflation ), total savings and investment , total consumption and so on. The focus of much of macroeconomic theory is analysis of the ways in which conscious government policies (and the unintended secondary consequences of these policies) can influence the overall &quoteconomic health&quot of the country for good and for ill. \[See also: microeconomics , aggregate demand , aggregate supply , [ref]gross national product , [ref]gross domestic product , fiscal policy , monetary policy , business cycle , inflation , unemployment rate , savings , investment , economics , political economy \]

Marginal analysis
  A concept employed constantly in microeconomic theory (and quite frequently in macroeconomic theory as well) is that of the marginal change in some economic variable (such as quantity of a good produced or consumed), or even the ratio of the marginal change in one variable to the marginal change in another variable. A marginal change is a proportionally very small addition or subtraction to the total quantity of some variable. Marginal analysis is the analysis of the relationships between such changes in related economic variables. Important ideas developed in such analysis include marginal [ref]cost , marginal revenue, marginal product, marginal rate of substitution, marginal propensity to save, and so on. In [ref]microeconomic theory, &quotmarginal&quot concepts are employed primarily to explicate various forms of &quotoptimizing&quot behavior. (Consumers are seen as striving to maximize their utility or satisfaction. Firms are seen as striving to maximize their profits.) The maximum value of such a variable is found by identifying a value of the independent variable such that either a marginal increase or a marginal decrease from that value causes the value of the dependent variable being maximized to fall. (The student of mathematics may recognize the opportunity to apply concepts from differential calculus here, with the various marginal concepts being special names given to first derivatives of particular functions.) The valuation of the benefits (utility ) and the [ref]costs of any good is determined &quotat the margin.&quot For the (individual or collective) decision maker pondering how many units of a good to consume or provide to the market, net total benefits (benefits minus [ref]costs ) will always be maximized at that level of consumption (or provision to the market) where the marginal benefit derived from adding the last unit equals the marginal addition to total [ref]costs of producing or acquiring that last additional unit. \[See also: optimum , cost \]

Marginal productivity
  See entry under productivity.

Market
  In its original meaning, a physical coming together of a sizable number of merchants and prospective customers at a pre-arranged time and place (in medieval Europe, typically once a week on the main square of the largest village in the vicinity) for the purpose of striking deals to buy and sell a variety of goods and services. Large numbers of customers came to such organized markets because they found it convenient to be able to make many of their necessary purchases on the same day in one central location (minimizing their total travel time and other travel costs) and because the presence of many merchants offering similar wares made it much more practical to comparison shop for the best deals in terms of quality and price. Merchants were often attracted from considerable distances to participate in such markets because of the opportunity to sell so many of their wares to such large numbers of potential customers in such a short time. Modern day flea markets, farmers' markets, gun shows and crafts fairs are fairly close to the original concept. In the language of modern industrial society, and especially in the language of professional economists, the concept of a market has been generalized and abstracted far beyond the original rather concrete and localized meaning of the term. In the more modern sense of the term, a market is the generalized name tag for the whole process that gets under way whenever a sizable number of people free to buy and/or sell a particular kind of good or service are in more or less close communication with each other (either personally and directly or else through the mediation of advertising, catalogs, news reports, postal carriers, telephone systems, computer networks, etc.) so that information about the terms of recent transactions and current offers to buy or sell is generally available to a large number of interested parties at relatively low cost -- regardless of the participants' physical proximity or distance. Such technological innovations of the industrial age as ever cheaper and more rapid transportation and communications over increasing distances both have dramatically increased the size of the areas from which buyers and sellers may be brought together to do business and have greatly reduced the need for them actually to meet face-to-face in one place in order to strike a bargain. The markets for many consumers' durable goods like automobiles or TVs and major agricultural and industrial commodities like oil, natural gas, wheat, beef, steel, forest products and computer chips are now literally world-wide in extent. (Of course, for many markets there do still exist central gathering places or locations that play an especially important role in the local, national or even worldwide networks of buyers and sellers -- for example, the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Commodities Exchange, the seasonal women's fashions shows in Paris and Milan, regional baseball card collectors conventions and so on -- but in nearly all such cases, it is not really necessary for an individual buyer or seller actually to travel to the relevant marketplace in order to participate in the broader markets of which these are nowadays only a part.) Where markets exist and are allowed to function reasonably freely, there are certain predictable consequences for the way the economy will operate. Elaboration of these consequences is the primary purpose of most of the research in the theoretical subfield of microeconomics. \[See also: market economy, capitalism, property rights, contract, microeconomics, transaction costs, competition\]

Market economy
  An economy in which scarce resources are all (or nearly all) [ref]allocated by the interplay of supply and demand in free [ref]markets , largely unhampered by government rationing, price-fixing or other coercive interference. In classifying real historical economies, the level of &quotmarketization&quot is not primarily an either/or issue but rather a matter of degree. The greater the proportion of the goods and services produced in the society that are allocated by market processes (rather than by government edict or the operation of unchangeable custom), the more meaningful it is to refer to its economy as a market economy -- and the more useful is the abstract economic theory of the operation of markets likely to be for understanding and even predicting economic behavior within that society. Probably the most critical single distinction between &quotbasically market&quot and &quotbasically non-market&quot ([ref]socialist , feudal, hunter-gatherer, etc.) economies is whether or not the determinations of what is to be produced and of the corresponding allocation of producers' goods (land, raw materials, machinery, and other &quotcapital,&quot as well as the services of labor) are accomplished primarily through free markets rather than primarily through government command or unalterable custom. The concept of a market presupposes the existence of certain sorts of property relations in the society involved. At least some goods and services must be legally or socially regarded as alienable property -- that is, there must be ascertainable individuals (or group representatives) who are recognized as having not just the right to use particular scarce economic resources for their own purposes but also the discretionary authority permanently to transfer such rights of use to someone else in exchange for some mutually agreeable quid pro quo, such as money or other goods or services. Not all human societies have recognized any such rights to transfer ownership, and most historical human societies have forbidden or placed stringent limits on the transferability of at least certain kinds of recognized property rights. In many societies (including most of Europe during the Middle Ages), individual or family rights to the perpetual use of particular plots of land were well established and protected by law -- but such rights only rarely could legally be sold to someone else because the land was socially regarded as fundamentally the inalienable property of either the local community as a whole or of the tribe or clan or church or perhaps of the reigning royal family. And even in the USA since 1865, while each person's ownership of his or her own body is well established, the law will still not allow you to make a binding contract to sell yourself into slavery or even to auction off your spare bodily organs for purposes of a surgical transplant.)

Market economy (Cont.)
Market Economy - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  It is worth noting for clarity's sake that the concept of a market does not logically presuppose the existence of &quotprivate property in the means of production&quot in the sense that private individuals or family households are the owners of land and capital and thus the recipients of profits, interest, rent etc. One may at least theoretically conceive of an economy of market [ref]socialism, in which workers' collectives, consumers' cooperatives, village communes or even autonomous state agencies leased from the state or held actual title to land, mines, factories, machinery and so forth -- so long as the socialist production organizations were free to buy and sell their output and and the use of their assigned land or capital assets to each other at freely negotiated prices responsive to conditions of supply and demand (assuming, of course, they are allowed to keep effective control of the bulk of the proceeds). There are, of course, both theoretical and practical problems with market [ref]socialism, and the costs and benefits of capitalist markets cannot be uncritically attributed to such a system. The larger point is that [ref]socialist economies have historically included varying proportions of &quotremnant&quot market elements in their make-up, and the theoretical possibilities for additional &quothybrid&quot forms are numerous. \[See also: [ref]market , [ref]property rights , [ref]factors of production , [ref]contract , [ref]microeconomics , [ref]transaction costs , [ref]competition , [ref]capitalism , [ref]socialist \] 

Merit good
merit good
  A good (or service) which some &quotoutside analyst&quot considers to be intrinsically desirable, uplifting or socially valuable for other people to consume, independently of the actual desires or preferences of the consumer himself. In the case of such goods, it is sometimes held that free consumer choice is inappropriate, and therefore that if many consumers left to themselves are unwilling to purchase &quotappropriate&quot quantities of such goods, they should be encouraged or even compelled to consume them anyway. Such arguments are often employed in an effort to justify government intervention in the market place to provide such alleged merit goods to the citizenry, either through direct government provision of the good at no cost to the consumer or through payment of tax-financed government subsidies that enable private providers to sell the good far below its true costs of production. Typical examples of alleged merit goods might include various forms of &quothigher culture&quot often ignored by &quotlowbrows&quot (grand opera and ballet performances, museums, uplifting documentaries or talking heads shows on PBS TV stations), the services of the clergy of The One True Religion, schoolroom instruction for children, etc. \[See also: demerit good , subsidy \]

Microeconomics
microeconomic
  The subdivision of the discipline of economics that studies the behavior of individual households and firms interacting through markets, how prices and levels of output of individual products are determined in these markets, the interconnections by which different markets affect each other, and how the price mechanism allocates resources and distributes income. \[See also: macroeconomics , economics , political economy \]

Monarchy
  A form of rule in which there is a single head of state, a monarch, with the title of King (or Queen) or its equivalent; in which the monarch holds his or her office for life; in which the position of monarch normally descends by rules of heredity only to members of a specific royal family; and where the monarch is popularly believed to be possessed of a religious or similar symbolic significance for the state and its institutions that legitimate his or her privileges. When the monarch rules with full or nearly full executive, legislative and judicial powers practically unlimited by constitutional or legal restrictions, the system is often referred to as an &quot;absolute monarchy.&quot; When the powers of the monarch are effectively limited and restricted by law (at least to insure respect for the subjects' recognized rights to personal freedom and property and often also to limit the monarch's powers of legislation and taxation), the system is normally referred to as &quot;constitutional monarchy.&quot; \[See also: republic, autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy, state, dictatorship, theocracy\]

Monetary policy
  That part of the government's economic policy which tries to control the size of the total stock of money (and other highly liquid financial assets that are close substitutes for money) available in the national economy in order to achieve policy objectives that are often partly contradictory: controlling the rate of increase in the general price level (inflation ), speeding up or slowing the overall rate of economic growth (mainly by affecting the interest rates that constitute such a large share of suppliers' costs for new investment but partly by influencing consumer demand through the availability of consumer credit and mortgage money), managing the level of unemployment (stimulating or retarding total demand for goods and services by manipulating the amount of money in the hands of consumers and investors), or influencing the exchange rates at which the national currency trades for other foreign currencies (mainly by pushing domestic interest rates above or below foreign interest rates in order to attract or discourage foreign savings from entering or leaving domestic financial markets). Monetary policy is said to be &quoteasy,&quot &quotloose,&quot or &quotexpansionary&quot when the quantity of money in circulation is being rapidly increased and short-term interest rates are thus being pushed down. Monetary policy is said to be &quottight&quot or &quotcontractionary&quot when the quantity of money available is being reduced (or else allowed to grow only at a slower rate than in the recent past) and short-term interest rates are thus being pushed to higher levels. The government's ability to control the size of the money stock and the levels of interest rates is only partial, not absolute. This is because monetary policy makers must rely mainly on influencing the privately-owned banking system's supply schedule for loaned funds. Monetary policy makers are much less able to affect the private sector's demand schedule for such funds, yet both supply and demand for money interact to determine the quantity of money created and its price, the interest rate. Even in trying to control the supply side of the loan market, it is easier for the Fed to force the banks to tighten credit and make fewer new loans (by raising the legal reserve requirements, for example) than it is to convince them to extend a larger volume of loans when bankers have become worried about their prospects for being repaid (or fear rapid inflation will cause their repayments to be worth less than the original value of the their loans). Government monetary policy-makers are generally much more successful in manipulating short-term interest rates (rates on loans for periods of less than a year) than they are in manipulating medium-term interest rates (1 to 5 years) and long-term interest rates (more than five years). This is because demand and supply for medium-term and long-term loans tend to be both much more elastic and much more affected by the public's expectations about future rates of inflation than the supply and demand for short-term loans are. A very expansionary monetary policy may well lower short-term interest rates by flooding the banks and financial markets with loanable funds and yet at the same time may actually raise longer-term interest rates by prompting fears among lenders that inflation will soon be accelerating.

Monetary policy - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Unfortunately, medium and long-term interest rates have much more influence on the rate of growth of the economy and on levels of unemployment than short-term interest rates do, because major new investment spending like research and development for new products or the construction of whole new factories are long-term projects that require long-term financing, and they are much less likely to be undertaken if long-term interest costs are high than if they are low. \[See also: [ref]Federal Reserve System , [ref]money , [ref]money stock , [ref]inflation , [ref]interest rate , [ref]discount rate , [ref]reserve requirement , [ref]open market operations, [ref]elasticity, [ref]banking, [ref]unemployment\] 

Money
  Any generally accepted medium of exchange -- that is, anything which is generally acceptable in a particular society as a means of payment or of settling debts arising out of exchanges on credit. Put slightly differently, money is a very special sort of good for which a very large proportion of the demand (at the extreme, all of the demand) is derived from people's (realistic) expectations that it can be quickly and easily re-exchanged for some other more immediately desired good or service (rather than the demand arising from a desire to personally consume the money-good itself). The earliest forms of money arose spontaneously in barter economies when experienced traders identified certain commodities that were so widely desired for actual use in the society that they could reasonably count on their acceptability as payment in almost any trade. Monetary demand for such commodities was further enhanced if they also had other physical properties making them especially convenient to use for trade -- such as durability, portability, ease of storage, uniformity of quality, easy divisibility, and so on. That is, demand for these goods derived from their desireability as a medium of exchange was gradually &quotadded on&quot to the pre-existing demand for them as objects of direct utility. Historical monetary systems have flourished on the basis not only of useful metals such as gold, silver, copper, bronze and iron but also on the basis of salt, tobacco, cattle and other livestock, furs and other animal hides, grain, gourds, beads, sea shells, feathers, and even transferable titles to particular coconut trees. In present day industrialized economies, money normally consists mostly of abstract claims on government or on heavily government-regulated banks (&quotfiat money&quot) -- claims such as token coins and paper currency or central bank notes or even magnetic tape entries representing one's checking account balance at a government insured bank that theoretically entitles one to withdraw cash on demand. Historically such government sponsored currency usually originated as &quotIOU's&quot in which the government (or its central bank) promised to redeem the tokens on demand (perhaps only after some future deadline) with &quotreal money&quot -- i.e., fixed quantities of gold, silver or what have you. However, government promises of redemption have by the 20th century largely been withdrawn or downwardly adjusted, and these tokens have very little (or no) intrinsic or use value. Nevertheless, in relatively &quotstable&quot countries (like the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Japan or Germany) fiat currencies remain generally acceptable as a means of payment because people think that they &quotknow for sure&quot the currency can be used to satisfy their tax bills, because legal tender laws usually require private creditors to accept them to discharge contractual debts, and because people generally have come to believe through favorable past experience that the official government money will continue to be widely acceptable in exchange for an at least moderately predictable quantity of goods and services in the private markets in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the confidence with which people hold their expectations about the future value of any given variety of fiat money is extremely fragile. [ref]More...

Money (Cont.)
Money - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  Confidence in the value of fiat money is easily and quickly undermined under conditions of political or economic instability, especially when the government has already been observed reneging on some of its many other solemn promises and obligations and when the money stock is clearly being expanded at an extremely rapid rate -- with the result that a number of such national currencies have become worthless virtually overnight in the course of the 20th century's all too numerous war- and revolution-related hyperinflations. \[See also: [ref]barter, [ref]transaction costs, [ref]money stock, [ref]monetary policy, [ref]inflation, [ref]hyperinflation, [ref]deflation, [ref]banking\] 

Money stock
  (Also sometimes loosely referred to as the money supply, a term that, strictly speaking, should be reserved for the entire supply schedule of associated interest rates and the quantities of money that would be created at those rates.) The money stock is the total amount of money available in a particular economy at a particular point in time. Since many different things may serve more or less well as money (or close money substitutes), and since several different sorts of things may be serving as money at the same time in any particular economy, precise definition and measurement of the money stock presents some serious practical problems for the policy maker who wishes to use manipulation of the growth (or contraction) of the money stock as a tool of economic policy. The narrowest definition of the money stock in common use by the advanced industrial countries today (&quotM1&quot) includes only the paper currency and coinage in circulation among the public plus the total balances instantly available to depositors in privately held checking accounts (&quotdemand deposits&quot or &quotsight deposits&quot) in the country's commercial [ref]banks and similar depository institutions (like savings and loans, credit unions, etc.). (A very large proportion of checking account money, of course, is simply created by the [ref]banks themselves as they extend loans to borrowers by simply crediting their borrowers' checking account balances with the amounts loaned). Travelers' checks are also included in M1 in some countries, including the US. &quotM2,&quot the next broadest measure of the money stock, adds on to the totals included in M1 the total amount of deposits in short-term savings accounts and small certificates of deposit. There are a number of still broader definitions of the money stock (&quotM3,&quot &quotM4,&quot &quotL,&quot etc.) that go on to add in such only slightly less liquid money-like assets as checkable money market mutual funds, larger denomination bank certificates of deposit, credit card credit limits, pre-approved lines of credit, and so on. \[See also: money , monetary policy , banking \]

Monopoly
  Literally, &quot;single seller.&quot; A situation in which a single firm or individual produces and sells the entire output of some good or service available within a given market. If there are no close substitutes for the good or service in question, the monopolist will be able to set both the level of output and the price at such a level as to maximize profits without worrying about being undercut by competitors (at least in the short run). If demand for the good or service being sold by the monopolist is highly inelastic, prices and the rate of profit in the industry will tend to be higher (and output lower) than under competitive conditions and prices may in fact be noticeably higher than the marginal costs of production for substantial periods of time. To keep new competitors from entering the industry and flooding the market with additional supply in response to the unusually high rate of profit, monopolists historically have typically had to rely in the long run upon some sort of legal barriers to entry erected by government -- either an open grant of protected monopoly that legally forbids competitors to enter the market, or a regulatory regime that in practice makes it almost impossible for new competitors to meet required standards, or perhaps only such more transient barriers to entry as legally protected patent rights or copyrights for essential technology. However, see also entries under barriers to entry, cartel, natural monopoly and competition.

Monopsony
  Literally, single buyer. A situation in which a single firm or individual is the only buyer of a particular good or service within a given market. \[See also: monopoly, competition\]

Nation
  A large aggregation or agglomeration of people sharing a common and distinctive racial, linguistic, historical and/or cultural heritage that has led its members to think of themselves as belonging to a valued natural community sharing a common destiny that ought to be preserved forever. \[See also: nation state, nationalism\]

Nation state
  A form of state in which those who exercise power claim legitimacy for their rule partly or solely on the grounds that their power is exercised for the promotion of the distinctive interests, values and cultural heritage of a particular nation whose members ideally would constitute all, or most of, its subject population and all of whom would dwell within the borders. \[See also: nation, state\]

National debt
  As usually defined, this denotes the total sum of the outstanding debt obligations of a country's central government. (But occasionally writers may use the term somewhat more broadly to refer to the total indebtedness of all levels of government, including regional and local governments, and sometimes also the indebtedness of government owned business entities such as local transit and communications systems or nationalized industries as well.) The national debt represents the accumulated total of all the government budget deficits of past years, less the accumulated total of all the government budget surpluses of past years. For most developed countries, such as the United States, the national debt consists almost entirely of interest-bearing &quot;IOU&quot; instruments that are usually re-sellable on organized financial markets (such as, for example, U.S. bonds, U.S. treasury notes, and U.S. treasury bills). These IOUs are originally purchased from the Treasury by private individuals, private corporations, insurance companies, pension funds and banks (both inside the United States and outside its borders), and the Treasury then uses the money thus raised to bridge its spending gap when its budget is in deficit. (The Treasury also sells IOUs to other Federal agencies that operate so-called trust funds -- primarily the Social Security Administration and other Federal retirement programs -- but since this is money that the government &quot;owes to itself,&quot; it is not counted as part of the national debt in any realistic system of accounting.) Money to pay the annual interest owed to the owners of the government's debt instruments has to be provided through appropriations in every year's Federal budget and, indeed, these interest payments on the national debt nowadays always constitute one of the two or three largest spending categories in the budget. \[See also: budget deficit, budget surplus, monetary policy, open market operations, Federal Reserve System\]

Nationalism
  An ideology, or rather a whole category of similar [ref]ideologies, based on the premise that each nation (or at least the [ref]ideologist's own nation) constitutes a natural political community whose members should all live together under the authority of &quot;their own&quot; independent nation state. When the people of one nation live in large numbers in a multi-ethnic state or in [ref]states with government(s) dominated by political elites drawn from another nationality, nationalism often becomes an ideology justifying rebellion or secession in order to create or recreate a nation state for the heretofore subjugated nation. When substantial numbers of people seen as belonging to the nation live outside the borders of their own nation state, nationalism often becomes an ideology justifying an aggressive foreign policy striving to expand the state's borders to include them. Nationalist ideologies usually claim that their respective nation possess special national characteristics or virtues that make them morally and intellectually superior to all other [ref]nations and should qualify their nation state for a special or privileged role in the world at large.\[See also: ideology, nation, state, nation state, fascism\]

Nationalization
  The involuntary transfer of ownership of a private business or other private property to a national government, either through uncompensated seizure (expropriation) or through forced sale at a government-determined price. \[See also: socialism\]

Natural monopoly
  A monopoly that does not arise from government intervention in the marketplace to protect a favored firm from competition but rather from special characteristics of the production process in the industry under the current state of technology. Theoretically, natural monopoly arises when there are very large &quoteconomies of scale&quot relative to the existing demand for the industry's product, so that the larger the quantity of the good a single factory produces, the cheaper the average costs per unit get -- right up to production at a level more than sufficient to supply the entire demand in the relevant market area. This might occur when production of the good requires extremely large initial capital investments to even enter the market in a modest way but then producing additional output requires only very modest additional outlays beyond the fixed initial investment. Under such circumstances, the firm that initially starts out with the largest share of the market is in a position to price its output at a level below its (higher cost) competitors' costs of production and still make a profit while driving them out of the business -- and the larger its market share gets, the lower its unit costs become, until a monopoly position is finally obtained. (It is often argued that local telephone service, natural gas supply, and electrical power distribution fall into this category because of the heavy initial investments in networks of telephone lines, electrical lines and gas lines that are involved.) From the point of view of the rest of society, this single firm monopoly is potentially a blessing, since the one firm can in fact produce the amounts of the good they will demand at a lower total cost in resources than multiple competing firms could. However, once the firm has attained a monopoly position, there is the likelihood that it will use its unusual dominance of this market to maximize profits by restricting output below the level which a competitive market would lead to and raising prices above competitive levels. This would lower overall social welfare below the maximum theoretically achievable because price would be set above marginal costs of production. It is therefore argued by some economists that such natural monopolies represent instances of &quotmarket failure&quot and that this justifies government stepping in to regulate prices and output levels in such an industry so that price will more closely approximate marginal costs of production. (However, since the &quotnatural monopolist&quot by definition faces a situation where his marginal costs will be lower than his average per unit costs, forcing him to accept a price equal to his marginal cost will result in his always making a loss rather than a profit from his business. Consequently, the government regulators would either have to pay the monopolist a subsidy to allow him a &quotfair return&quot on his investment or else fix the price of the product above its marginal costs of production anyway to accomplish the same end at greater social cost -- which is the usual approach taken.)

Oligarchy
  Any system of government in which virtually all political power is held by a very small number of wealthy but otherwise unmeritorious people who shape public policy primarily to benefit themselves financially through direct subsidies to their agricultural estates or business firms, lucrative government contracts, and protectionist measures aimed at damaging their economic competitors -- while displaying little or no concern for the broader interests of the rest of the citizenry. &quotOligarchy&quot is also used as a collective term to denote all the individual members of the small corrupt ruling group in such a system. The term always has a negative or derogatory connotation in both contemporary and classical usage, in contrast to aristocracy (which sometimes has a derogatory connotation in modern usage, but never in classical). \[See also: elite (elitist) theory , aristocracy , republic , democracy , fascism , state , protectionism , subsidy , monopoly \]

Open market operations
  Sales or purchases of government debt instruments (treasury bonds, treasury bills, treasury notes) on the open financial markets by a country's central bank (in the U.S., the Federal Reserve) as part of its efforts to influence the size of the money supply and the levels of interest rates. Central bank decisions to buy up government debt instruments make for an expansionary monetary policy, while sales of government debt instruments by the central bank represent a contractionary monetary policy. [ref]When the Fed enters the financial markets and buys U.S. government securities, it pays for them by checks drawn on the Federal Reserve Bank's own account with itself, which the sellers of the securities then deposit in their own private bank accounts. The private banks in turn deposit the Fed's checks in their own accounts at the Fed -- which means that the private banks now have extra reserves on which they can extend additional loans to their customers, thus tending to expand the size of the money stock and (in the short run, at least) to lower [ref]interest rates. (For example, if the reserve requirement is 20%, banks can legally create five times the amount of these new reserves by simply crediting the checking accounts of new borrowers.) Conversely, when the Fed enters the financial markets and sells government securities it owns, the buyers pay for them with checks drawn on their accounts at their own banks and the Fed presents the checks for collection. When these checks clear and the private banks pay over the funds to the Fed, the private banks' deposits at the regional Federal Reserve banks decline by the amounts of these checks, reducing the private banks' reserves and thus reducing the amount of the loans that the banks may legally have outstanding. This tends to decrease the size of the [ref]money stock and (in the short term, at least) to raise [ref]interest rates. For example, if the reserve requirement is 20% and a particular bank is operating right at the legal minimum of reserves, it will have to reduce quickly the amount of the loans outstanding to its customers by five times the amount of the reduction in the bank's reserves in order to maintain the legally required reserve percentage. \[See also: banking, Federal Reserve System, monetary policy, money stock, national debt, discount rate\]

Opportunity cost
  See entry under cost.

Optimum
  The very &quot;best&quot; possible situation or state of affairs according to some explicit objective that provides a precise standard of evaluation. For example, if a business firm's objective is to make the biggest profits possible (as economists generally assume it is), then the firm's optimal level of output at any given level of sales prices and production costs is that at which its profits will be the highest possible. Most of economics is concerned with analyzing how individuals or groups of people or even whole societies may achieve optimal use of available resources, and it is normally assumed that the maximum satisfaction of people's individual wants or desires \[see: utility\] is the objective of the economy that provides the relevant standard of evaluation. (Social critics, moral philosophers, religious thinkers, and political power-seekers in their various ways have often disputed the validity of this individualistic standard of evaluation, of course.) \[See also: marginal analysis\]

Organizational process models of decision-making
  Where formal organizations are the setting in which decisions are made, the particular decisions or policies chosen by decision-makers can often be explained through reference to the organization's particular structure and procedural rules. Such explanations typically involve looking at the distribution of responsibilities among organizational sub-units, the activities of committees and ad hoc coordinating groups, meeting schedules, rules of order etc. The notion of fixed-in-advance standard operating procedures (SOPs) typically plays an important role in such explanations of individual decisions made. \[See also: rational-comprehensive decision-making , incrementalism (incrementalist decision-making) , systems theory models of decision-making , bureaucratic politics , bureaucracy \]

Phillips' curve
  In the late 1950s, the British economist A.W. Phillips demonstrated an inverse statistical association between annual changes in average wage rates and the rate of unemployment . When the annual wage growth rates and unemployment rates for Great Britain for each of the years from 1861 to 1957 were plotted as points on a two-dimensional graph, they rather neatly approximated a shallow hyperbola-shaped curve convex to the origin of the graph. That is, in years when unemployment rates were low, average money wages tended to grow rapidly; but in years when unemployment rates were high, average money wages tended to grow little or even to decline. Other economists soon repeated Phillips's procedures with similar data from a number of other industrialized countries and mostly found similar statistical relationships. At the time, many Keynesian economists reasoned from this finding as follows: Because unemployment rates and wage increase rates are inversely related, the traditional government goals of maintaining both low inflation and low unemployment would seem to be inconsistent. Because wages are such a large share of the costs of production, rapid increases in average wages are bound to push up the general price level. There is a trade-off relationship between inflation and unemployment , and economic policy makers will have to choose the mix of inflation and unemployment that they find most acceptable according to their political and ideological commitments. Conservative policy makers may be willing to choose low inflation even at the cost of enduring high unemployment , whereas liberal or socialist policy makers may be expected to pursue more inflationary policies because of their deeper commitments to full employment. The Phillips curve may be expected to remain fixed and stable and provide the menu of precise numerical combinations of inflation and unemployment that policy makers have available to choose from. One result of widespread acceptance of the &quotPhillips curve&quot trade-off theory was to make inflation a bit more politically respectable. Moderate inflation was now not so much seen as an unambiguous failure of economic policy but rather could be presented to the public as &quotthe price we have to pay for keeping unemployment low.&quot Political critics of inflationary monetary or fiscal policies could now be charicatured as advocates of jacking up the unemployment rate and thus bringing misery to millions of working class families. Not too surprisingly, the one or two percent long-term average inflation rates characteristic of nearly all the advanced industrialized countries during peacetime over the past century or so began to give way in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s to rather higher inflation rates. During this same period, the earlier assumption that the historically estimated Phillips curve represented a rather stable relationship proved to be grossly inaccurate.[ref]More...

Phillips' curve (Cont.)
Phillips' curve - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The 1960s, and especially the 1970s, provided economists with numerous new data points that did not fall along the old Phillips curves for the industrialized countries but rather were well to the right of the older data points on the graph. In the new era, higher rates of [ref]inflation coexisted everywhere with unexpectedly high rates of [ref]unemployment. It seemed to require higher and higher doses of [ref]inflation than before to bring [ref]unemployment down to any given level. More recent economic analysis of the [ref]trade-off between [ref]inflation and [ref]unemployment considerably modifies the simplistic stable Phillips curve theory of the past. It is now recognized that both labor and management incorporate their expectations about the likely future rate of [ref]inflation into their bargaining positions in wage negotiations, since it is the real purchasing power of the future wage payments rather than simply the nominal number of currency units that matter to them. As average [ref]inflation rates in the industrial countries rose over time, labor and management eventually began adjusting their inflationary expectations for the future upward as well, and wage settlements began to reflect these higher long-term expectations. As a result, the Phillips curve shifts upward and outward to a higher level, further away from the origin of the graph. Government policy makers now can lower [ref]unemployment rates (in the short to medium term) only by creating a rate of [ref]inflation even more rapid than the public previously had come to expect -- and this works for only so long as it takes the public to adjust their expectations upward in the light of their new experiences. \[See also: [ref]inflation, [ref]unemployment rate, [ref]macroeconomics, [ref]trade-off, [ref]monetary policy, [ref]fiscal policy, [ref]trade-off, [ref]business cycle\] 

Pluralist theory
  The theoretical point of view held by many social scientists which holds that American politics is best understood through the generalization that power is relatively broadly (though unequally) distributed among many more or less organized interest groups in society that compete with one another to control public policy, with some groups tending to dominate in one or two issue areas or arenas of struggle while other groups and interests tend to dominate in other issue areas or arenas of struggle. There tends to be little overlap between those leaders who participate most influentially in one policy area and those who are influential in other policy areas, and what linkage there is tends to come from popularly elected political officials (especially political executives and party leaders) who, by the nature of their jobs, must exercise leadership (or act as brokers) in a number of different policy areas. There is no single, unified &quotpower elite,&quot but rather there are many competing power elites with differing backgrounds, values and bases of support in the broader society. Government tends to be depicted as a mechanism for mediating and compromising a constantly shifting balance between group interests rather than as an active innovator or imposer of policies upon society. \[See also: elite (elitist) theory , interest group , political party \]

Political business cycle
  A business cycle that results primarily from the manipulation of policy tools (fiscal policy, monetary policy) by incumbent politicians hoping to stimulate the economy just prior to an election and thereby greatly improve their own and their party's reelection chances. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies have politically popular consequences in the short run (tax cuts, falling unemployment, falling interest rates, new government spending on services for special interests, etc.). Unfortunately these very policies, especially if pursued to excess, can also have very unpleasant consequences in the longer term (accelerating inflation, an unsustainably low rate of savings to support future investment, damage to the foreign trade balance, long-term expansion of government's share of the GNP at the expense of people's disposable incomes, etc.). So immediately after the election is over (and the next election is far away), politicians tend to &quotbite the bullet&quot and reverse course by raising taxes, cutting spending, slowing the growth of the money supply, allowing interest rates to rise, etc. Thus the regular holding of elections tends to produce a boom-and-bust pattern in the economy because of the on-again-off-again pattern of government stimulus and restraint encouraged by trying to schedule an artificial boom at every election time. \[See also: business cycle , fiscal policy , inflation , interest rate(s) , monetary policy , unemployment , political party , agency problem \]

Political economy
  A branch of the social sciences that takes as its principal subject of study the interrelationships between political and economic institutions and processes. That is, political economists are interested in analyzing and explaining the ways in which various sorts of government affect the allocation of scarce resources in society through their laws and policies as well as the ways in which the nature of the economic system and the behavior of people acting on their economic interests affects the form of government and the kinds of laws and policies that get made. \[See also: economics, political science\]

Political party
  An organized group that has as its fundamental aim the attainment of political power and public office for its designated leaders. Usually, a political party will advertise a common commitment by its leaders and its membership to a set of political, social, economic and/or cultural values (an &quot;ideology&quot;) that distinguish it from other political parties and which supposedly provide the basis for the policies the party proposes to implement or maintain through its members who obtain public office. A political party differs from a pressure group in that a pressure group is primarily interested in influencing whatever government officials actually happen to be in office rather than in attaining office for its own leaders, and accordingly interest groups do not normally put forward candidates for public office under their own name (although they may sometimes endorse particular candidates put forward by party organizations). In a democracy, political parties primarily function as agencies for recruiting suitable candidates to run for elective office and for organizing and conducting election campaigns. They may also become important in selecting candidates for appointive political office when winning the election has provided the party's leaders with power to appoint new officials to the cabinet and other top policy-making positions in the government bureaucracy. 

Political science
  The branch of the social sciences that is primarily concerned with analyzing and explaining the functioning of political institutions (especially governmental institutions) as well as the political behavior of individuals, groups and organizations in their efforts to influence or resist the decisions and policies of government.

Popular sovereignty
  The political/legal principle that all legitimate political authority within a society derives ultimately from the will or, at least, from the generalized consent of the subject population. [ref]\[See also: legitmacy, ideology\]

Populism
  The [ref]ideologies of any of a number of political movements that demand the redistribution of political power, economic dominance and/or cultural leadership away from what are seen as corrupt, greedy, over-centralized, urban-based [ref]oligarchies in favor of empowering &quotthe common people,&quot particularly those who live in rural or small-town areas, since such people are typically idealized by populists as embodying a simpler, more virtuous way of life based on traditional values and customs. Populists generally believe in the [ref]elitist theory of politics as the best description of how policy-making works, and they find it completely [ref]illegitimate . Populists characteristically favor strong but fairly selective government intervention in the economy to counteract market forces undermining the viability of favored traditional occupations such as small farming and small-scale commercial activities. Populists typically also favor strong government action to stop the spread of non-traditional religious and cultural values and to punish and repress minorities pursuing unconventional or &quotforeign&quot life-styles. Sociologically-oriented historians usually interpret the growth of populist protest movements as a backward-looking reaction against the stresses of rapid economic and technological change and the painful disruptions of traditional values and customs that accompany such changes; however the policy measures pushed through by successful populist movements in order to protect traditional ways of life have themselves often produced unintended but nevertheless radical changes in politics, the economy and society. \[See also: ideology , [ref]legitimacy , elite (elitist) theory \]

Pork-barrel legislation
  Appropriations of public funds by Congress (or other legislative assemblies) for projects that do not serve the interests of any large portion of the country's citizenry but are nevertheless vigorously promoted by a small group of legislators because they will pump outside taxpayers' money and resources into the local districts these legislators represent. Successful promotion of such pork-barrel legislation (often through skillful logrolling) is very likely to get the legislator re-elected by his constituents. Classic examples of such pork-barrel legislation include Federal [ref]appropriations bills for dams, river and harbor improvements, bridge and highway construction, and job-training centers, as well as legislation designed to prevent closure of obsolete or unneeded military installations, prisons, VA hospitals and the like. \[See also: appropriation bill, logrolling\]

Pressure group
pressure groups
  See entry under interest group .

Price controls
  A form of government intervention in the economy in which a government agency uses its law-making power to regulate the prices at which otherwise voluntary private exchanges may take place. The government agency may attempt to fix and enforce the exact prices at which a particular good or service may be sold (as for example when state regulatory commissions fix the rates for electricity, gas or water to be sold by monopoly utility companies in particular geographic areas). Alternatively, the government agency may be content to set &quot;ceiling prices&quot; or &quot;floor prices&quot; for particular goods or services. Ceiling price controls set a maximum price that may be charged but do not prohibit transactions at lower prices below the ceiling price (for example, rent control). Floor price controls set a minimum price that may legally be charged but do not prohibit transactions at higher prices above the floor price (for example, minimum wage laws).

Private enterprise
  A business or other economic organization not owned by the government but rather operated for profit or other private benefit.

Private property rights
  The basic rights of individuals (and organizations or associations of people functioning as a single conglomerate &quot;legal person&quot; such as corporations, partnerships, churches, non-profit foundations, etc.) to the peaceful possession, control and enjoyment of the things they own as well as their rights to make contracts to rent, sell or give away all or part of their various ownership rights over these possessions (or these possessions' services) to any other people willing to accept the owners' terms. The possessions over which a person has property rights may be tangible (like real estate, factory machinery, livestock, automobiles or a jack-knife) or intangible (like contractual obligations to provide goods or services at some time in the future, shares of common stock in a corporation, bonds, insurance policies, the right to broadcast over a designated radio frequency, patents, trademarks and copyrights). In highly specialized societies, property rights over particular resources may be &quot;unbundled&quot; and parcelled out among many individuals according to quite complex rules of division of authority over particular aspects or uses of the resource specified in written contracts -- for example, separating mineral rights from surface rights to a parcel of land, utility easements over the same land, restrictive deed covenants and so on. \[See also: property rights, contract, market\]

Private sector
  The part of an economy in which goods and services are produced and distributed by individuals and organizations that are not part of the government or state bureaucracy. \[See also: public sector\]

Productivity
  The value of output (goods and services) produced per unit of input (productive resources) used. Thus an increase in productivity means producing more goods and services with the same amount of resources, or producing the same goods and services with fewer resources, or some combination of these two possibilities. While productivity is often measured or referred to only in terms of the productivity of labor (output per man-hour), a more precise and complete view of the sources of productivity incorporates the effects of all inputs to production, including capital, land and materials. The principal means of increasing overall productivity are: Greater specialization and a more complex division of labor (often involving a geographical or territorial expansion of the relevant market area, incorporating new people with different skills and endowments of natural resources) Investment in increasing the stock of capital goods Investment in so-called [ref]human capital (for example, teaching workers new or more efficient production skills Technological innovation that creates new ways of combining somewhat different inputs of the factors of production to produce the same goods at lower costs. The concept of the marginal productivity of an input in a productive process is a particularly important idea in economic analysis, because under competitive conditions, the equilibrium price of a factor of production (including wages, interest etc) will tend toward equality with its marginal productivity. Marginal productivity is the increase in the value of output that can be produced by adding in one more unit of the particular input while holding other inputs constant. Thus the higher the productivity of a factor of production, the higher the income that may be expected to accrue to its providers, and anything that raises overall levels of productivity within a society may be expected to increase the average overall prosperity of the society as a whole. \[See also: marginal analysis , supply, law of , factors of production , capital , land , labor , human capital , diminishing returns, law of \]

Profit
  The amount of the excess of total sales revenue over the total costs of production of the good(s) or service(s) produced by a business firm. [ref]The term &quot;profit&quot; is used somewhat more narrowly by economists than the way it is used by the Internal Revenue Service or even by most businessmen and accountants. The economists' concept of profit emphasizes that &quot;costs of production&quot; for purposes of the definition include the full opportunity costs of all the factors of production utilized -- an amount for each reflecting what it could yield if employed in the most lucrative available alternative use. This would include not only the amount of money actually paid out for wages, materials, rent, machinery and what have you but also what the money tied up in the business could otherwise be earning in other uses at similar levels of risk. Whereas accountants and the IRS do not subtract out the opportunity costs of capital (unless interest is actually being paid by the firm to an outside lender), economists would insist that &quot;profit&quot; in the true sense refers only to what is left after deduction of the going rate of return on capital for the owners equity in the business as well. In other words, for the economist, the owners' profit does not technically include the amount of &quot;interest&quot; that they should be paying themselves for the use of their own capital -- pure economists' profit includes only what the owners are making above and beyond the going rate of interest they could be making by loaning out their financial resources rather than using them to run a business. So a firm that is managing to cover all its bills and its maintenance/ replacement costs out of sales with, say, 5% of the value of the investment left over at the end of each year would not technically be making a profit in the eyes of an economist if the owners could be making 5% on their invested capital by just putting it in a CD at the bank or savings and loan. The IRS and most accountants would still say that same firm is &quot;profitable&quot; in their usage of the term. In the case of unincorporated firms where the owner (or owners) works full time in the business, the divergence between economists' definition of profit and the IRS/accounting definition of profit is still larger because any &quot;salary&quot; that an owner- manager takes out of the till for his living expenses is still counted by the IRS as part of the profits (and hence, in the eyes of the IRS, &quot;unearned income&quot;); the economist, on the other hand would deduct what the owner-manager's services could command as an employee elsewhere from profits as part of the labor costs of production. Profits (in the economists' sense, but not in the accounting sense) are a direct measure of the net increase in total value generated by employing scarce resources in one particular use rather than in their most valuable alternative use in some other undertaking. Economic profitability indicates (in the absence of externalities) that consumers value the product more than any others that could have been produced with the resources expended. Conversely, losses indicate that resources have been used unwisely -- the firm has miscalculated, and the resources committed could better have been used to produce other products more desired by consumers. Hence follows the famous conclusion of Adam Smith that in selfishly seeking to maximize his profits the businessman unwittingly is also maximizing the benefits to society as a whole from the efficient utilization of the resources under his control.

Progressive tax
  A tax that tends to take a smaller percentage of the incomes of lower income citizens compared to the percentage it takes of the incomes of wealthier citizens. Example: an income tax with steeper rates for those in higher income brackets, or a special sales tax levied only on expensive &quot;luxuries&quot; like yachts or jewelry. \[See also: regressive tax\]

Propaganda
  Persuasive communications directed at a specific audience that are designed to influence the targeted audience's opinions, beliefs and emotions in such a way as to bring about specific, planned alterations in their behavior. The information communicated by the propagandist may be true or false, the values appealed to may be sincerely held by the propagandist or cynically manipulated, and the presentation may be either logically and dispassionately argued or rhetorically tailored to arouse the most irrational emotions and prejudices -- but the message content of propaganda is always deliberately selected and slanted to lead the audience toward a predetermined mindset that benefits the cause of the propagandist. \[See also: legitimacy\]

Property rights
  A property right is the exclusive authority to determine how and by whom a particular resource is used. More broadly, property rights may be seen as a bundle of separate and distinct rights over a particular good -- including at least the right of personal use, the right to demand compensation as a prerequisite for its use by other people, and the right to transfer any or all of these rights to others (either permanently by sale or temporarily through some form of contractual arrangement). Property rights may be exercised by governments through their designated officials (public ownership or public property) as well as by private individuals and other sorts of non-governmental organizations (private property). \[See also: private property rights, contract, market\]

Protectionism
  Any of several political-economic doctrines that have in common advocating that government impose political barriers to international trade (usually taxes on imports or quantitative restrictions limiting the volume of legally allowable imports of each particular good) in order to &quot;protect&quot; a domestic firm (or firms) manufacturing these same goods from foreign competition and thereby make it (them) more profitable than would otherwise be the case under free competition. Although difficult to justify on the basis of economic theory, protectionist measures often enjoy considerable political support because it is usually much easier for a tiny group of firms (and their associated labor unions) that stand to benefit greatly from a protectionist measure to organize for political influence than it is for the much larger group of consumers who each stand to lose smaller individual amounts by the proposed measure -- even though the total losses normally greatly exceed the total gains. \[See also: tariff, tax, monopoly\]

Public goods
  Also called collective goods. These are a very special class of goods which cannot practically be withheld from one individual consumer without withholding them from all (the &quotnonexcludability criterion&quot) and for which the marginal cost of an additional person consuming them, once they have been produced, is zero (the &quotnonrivalrous consumption&quot criterion). The classic example of a nearly pure public good is national defense: you cannot defend the vulnerable border regions of a country from the ravages of foreign invaders without also simultaneously defending everyone else who lives within the borders. The inability of potential providers to exclude people who refuse to pay from nevertheless consuming and benefitting from an expensive public good usually means that very many of the consumers of the good will act as free riders and choose not to help pay for its provision. Consequently private production of the good or service may prove unprofitable, and the good or service thus may not be provided at all by the free market -- even though everyone might concede they would be better off with some positive level of production of the good in question. Actually, the public goods problem is not quite as hopeless as the simple version of the theory makes it sound. Various social arrangements have evolved to encourage the provision of public goods. The non-profit &quotthird sector&quot of the economy devotes considerable effort to the provision of public goods financed by voluntary contributions that are motivated by appeals to people's &quotcivic conscience&quot (or to their desire for the honors and respect that the community spontaneously accords to &quotpublic benefactors&quot). Voluntary contributions may also be gathered from those people most intensely and deeply concerned about the particular social need being addressed or from those who can be &quotshamed&quot into it by informal social pressures that withdraw status and respect from people identified and stigmatized as free riders . In addition to these non-profit approaches, the provision of public goods may often be handled through ordinary market forces if some way can be found to link the consumption of the public good to the consumption of some other good that does not suffer from the &quotnon-excludability&quot problem and hence can generate a profit. A shopping mall offers good examples of such &quottying&quot arrangements. The mall management provides such public goods to shoppers as security protection, a clean and pleasant environment, public water fountains and rest rooms, entertainment, etc. without direct charges -- but, since these amenities attract larger crowds of customers to the mall and increase sales for the stores located there, the mall's owners are able to command higher rents from their tenants. It should also be noted that at least a partial provision of public goods often occurs when there is a single person (or a rather small group of persons) who feel they stand to benefit personally from a particular public good to such an unusually large degree that it is worthwhile for them to go ahead and just pay for the whole thing while ignoring the many other small-time free riders as irrelevant. (Remember, by the definition of a public good, the free riders' additional consumption does not cost anything extra.) [ref]More...

Public goods (Cont.)
Public goods - A Glossary of Political Economy Terms
  The classic &quotsolution&quot to the problem of under-provision of public goods has been government funding through compulsory taxation (often, but not necessarily, accompanied by actual government agency production of the good or service in question). Although this may substantially alleviate the problem of numerous &quotfree riders&quot that refuse to pay for the benefits they nevertheless love to receive, it should be noted that the political process does not provide any very plausible method for determining what the &quotoptimal&quot level of provision of a public good actually is. When we cannot observe what individuals are willing to give up in order to get the public good, how can we (or the politicians) assess how urgently they really want more or less of it, given the other possible uses of their money? So any given public good will still most likely be either under-provided or over-provided under government stewardship. Note also that the &quotpublic goods&quot problem is an extreme special case of the more general problem of [ref]externalities. \[See also: [ref]incentives\]

Public sector
  The part of an economy in which goods and services are produced and/or (re)distributed by government agencies. \[See also: private sector\]

Rational-comprehensive decision-making
  A theoretical model of how public policy decisions are (or perhaps ought to be) taken. All possible options or approaches to solving the problem under study are identified and the costs and benefits of each option are assessed and compared with each other. The option that promises to yield the greatest net benefit is selected. The main problem with rational-comprehensive approaches is that it is often very costly in terms of time and other resources that must be devoted to gathering the relevant information. Often the costs and benefits of the various options are very uncertain and difficult to quantify for rigorous comparison. The costs of undertaking rational- comprehensive decision-making may themselves exceed the benefits to be gained in improved quality of decisions. \[See also: incrementalism, bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics, organizational process models of decision-making, systems theory models of decision-making\]

Reaganomics
  See supply side economics.

Recession
  See: depression , business cycle , unemployment rate , fiscal policy , monetary policy , [ref]Phillips' curve .

Referendum
  A vote taken by the general public to decide an important legislative or policy issue directly (rather than having the issue decided by a representative assembly or other legislative agency). \[See also: democracy\]

Regressive tax
  A tax that tends to take a larger percentage of the incomes of lower income citizens than it takes from the incomes of higher income citizens. Examples: a poll tax, a flat percentage tax on only the first so many dollars of income (like the social security tax) or a sales tax on consumption items of common necessity (like groceries).

Rent
  The price paid (per unit of time) for the temporary use of a durable good (especially land and/or buildings) that the user does not own. Abbreviated expression for the specialized economists' term economic rent, which refers to the amount of any payment to the owner of a factor of production (land, labor or capital) that is above and beyond the minimum payment that would have been necessary to motivate that owner not to transfer it to some other use. Thus the economic rent in a sales transaction would be the difference between the payment actually received and the second-best price the owner could otherwise be getting for using that factor of production in some other application. \[See also: rent-seeking behavior, land, labor, capital, factors of production\]

Rent-seeking behavior
  The expenditure of resources in order to bring about an uncompensated transfer of goods or services from another person or persons to one's self as the result of a &quot;favorable&quot; decision on some public policy. The term seems to have been coined (or at least popularized in contemporary political economy) by the economist Gordon Tullock. Examples of rent-seeking behavior would include all of the various ways by which individuals or groups lobby government for taxing, spending and regulatory policies that confer financial benefits or other special advantages upon them at the expense of the taxpayers or of consumers or of other groups or individuals with which the beneficiaries may be in economic competition. \[See also: rent (meaning 2), captured agency, subsidy, protectionism, pork-barrel legislation, bureaucratic politics, oligarchy\]

Republic
  Originally, any form of government not headed by an hereditary monarch. In modern American usage, the term usually refers more specifically to a form of government (a.k.a. &quot;representative democracy&quot;) in which ultimate political power is theoretically vested in the people but in which popular control is exercised only intermittently and indirectly through the popular election of government officials and/or delegates to a legislative assembly rather than directly through frequent mass assemblies or legislation by referendum.\[See also: democracy, referendum, state, popular sovereignty\]

Reserve requirement
  The minimum percentage of their customers' total demand deposits (checking account balances) that banks are legally required to keep on hand in cash or as deposits in their accounts at the regional Federal Reserve bank. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is empowered to set the reserve requirement for member banks at its discretion. This power provides one of the Fed's more powerful policy tools for influencing the banks' willingness and ability to extend or call in loans, and thus to influence the size of the money stock and the level of prevailing interest rates. Lowering the reserve requirement is expansionary. Lowering the reserve requirement increases the bankers' availability of funds to make more loans, thus tending to expand the money stock and (in the short run at least) to lower interest rates and encourage both consumers and investors to buy more. Raising the reserve requirement represents a contractionary move by the Fed. Raising the reserve requirement restricts the bankers' ability to make more loans, and those banks that were already operating just barely above the old reserve requirement will probably be forced to call in some of their existing loans to meet the tougher new requirement, thus tending to shrink the money stock, raise interest rates, and thus reduce the volume of purchasing on credit in the economy as a whole. \[See also: Federal Reserve System, monetary policy, money stock, banking, money\]

Resources
  The available material means for pursuing human goals or desired objectives. \[See also: factors of production\]

right-to-work laws
  State laws that make it illegal for labor unions and employers to enter into [ref]contracts that provide for a business to employ only union members in the jobs covered by the contract. One typical version of a right-to-work law reads &quot;No person may be denied employment, and employers may not be denied the right to employ any person, because of that person's membership or non-membership in any labor organization.&quot; Labor union leaders typically seek the repeal of right-to-work laws because much lower percentages of workers choose to join unions and pay dues in states where such laws are in effect. Defenders of right-to-work laws tend to argue that workers who refuse to join unions mainly do so because they just do not value the collective bargaining services that unions perform and/or because they disagree with the political causes that unions support with their dues money. Opponents of right-to-work laws tend to see refusal to join a union mainly as attempting to be a free rider who enjoys the very real benefits of union representation without having to pay his fair share of the cost. About 20 US states have some version of such a law presently in effect. \[See also: contract, public goods\]

Right-wing, rightist
Right-wing
rightist
right-wing
  A general descriptive term for any of several otherwise rather different, conservative, reactionary or fascist political ideologies, the common denominator of which is their qualified or enthusiastic support for the main features of the current social and economic order, accepting all (or nearly all) of its inequalities of wealth, status and privilege (or even in some cases support for a return to an earlier, even more inegalitarian and hierarchical political-economic order.) Right wing ideologies tend to emphasize the values of order, patriotism, social cohesion, and a personal sense of duty that makes the individual citizen who &quotknows his place&quot responsive to discipline from his political and social superiors. In America, the term has a somewhat more derogatory flavor than in Europe. \[See also: ideology , legitimacy , left-wing , fascism , conservatism \]

Savings
savings
  All income of households (and firms) that is neither immediately spent on goods and services for final consumption nor taken by the government as taxes. Such savings may be held as balances in bank accounts or as cash on hand. Savings may be held for the purpose of subsequent investment or for some other purpose, such as accumulating sufficient funds for future consumption spending on big ticket items, maintaining an emergency reserve against the possibility of unpredicted consumption expenses, providing for post-retirement consumption spending, or even for the perverse psychological pleasures of hoarding in the miserly tradition of Silas Marner. \[See also: investment \]

Scarcity
  A condition where there is less of something available than at least some people would like to have if they could have them at no cost to themselves. Note that this technical economic definition of &quot;scarcity&quot; differs greatly from the notion of scarcity as &quot;unusual rarity&quot; that predominates in most ordinary language. (For example, automobiles are not currently &quot;scarce&quot; in Los Angeles in the sense of being rare or unusual to see, but they are definitely &quot;scarce&quot; in the economic sense because many Angelenos would certainly take more of them if they were being given away for free.) Because the total quantity of goods and services that people would like to have always far exceeds the amount which available economic resources are capable of producing in all known human societies, people as individuals and/or as members of larger social units must constantly be making choices about which desires to satisfy first and which to leave less than fully satisfied for the time being. That is, they must constantly decide how best to allocate (apportion or distribute) the scarce resources available to them among the various alternative uses to which they can be put. Thus scarcity is the fundamental condition that gives rise to the patterns of choosing behavior whose study constitutes the main focus of the academic discipline of economics. \[See also: optimum, marginal analysis, allocation, economics\]

Seniority (of a US Representative or Senator)
Seniority
  The number of years of unbroken service that a member of a standing Congressional committee has on that committee. The Rules of the House and Senate (and the rules of the Democratic and Republican caucusses within each chamber) have always given great weight to differences in seniority in allocating power and privileges among their members. The majority party committee member with the most seniority will almost invariably be selected as chairman of the committee and thus be awarded the power to hire and fire most of the committee's staff employees, to set meeting times, to determine which majority party members will be appointed to which subcommittees, to control what bills will be taken up for consideration, and so on. The minority party member of the committee with most seniority is designated the ranking minority member of the committee and thus gets to pick the minority party members of subcommittees, hire and fire the minority's (much smaller) share of the committee staffers, and generally act as his party's main spokesperson on committee matters to the chairman, as well as the mass media, etc. When bills drafted in the committee are reported out for debate by the whole House or the whole Senate, the Chairman and the ranking minority member get to decide which members of their party will be recognized to speak in the debate, and for how many minutes. All the other members of the committee are ranked according to their years of membership, and such matters as the order in which they get to speak during committee meetings or hearings, chairmanships of subcommittees and many other privileges are normally determined largely or entirely on the basis of their seniority within their party's ranks. 

Separation of powers
  One of the most important of the basic principles that guided the framers of the US Constitution in their design for America's future governance was the idea that the root cause and essence of tyrranical government is the concentration of control over all the powers and functions of government in the hands of the same individual or narrow political faction. The corollary the Framers drew from this was the separation of powers principle: that free popular government can best be sustained by dividing the various powers and functions of government among separate and relatively independent governmental institutions whose officials would be selected at different intervals and through different procedures by somewhat different constituencies so as to make it unlikely that the same small faction could gain control of them all at the same time. Thus, in the American federal republic the Framers designed, &quotthe power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments \[the Federal government and the governments of the several states\], and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments \[the executive, the legislative, and the judicial\].&quot \[Madison, The Federalist #51\] The idea that concentrated political power is a mortal danger to civil liberties and popular rights remains to this day one of the most persistent and characteristic features of American ideologies and popular thinking about politics. In comparison with other advanced industrial countries, the United States possesses one of the most complex governmental structures and perhaps the most broadly diffused distribution of governmental authority among independent agencies. Not only do American governmental arrangements still allocate power to separate executive, legislative and judicial branches at both the state and federal levels, but they also feature a great variety of forms of relatively autonomous and geographically overlapping governmental bodies at the local level -- including not only general purpose county and municipal governments but also a wide variety of functionally specialized mini-governments such as elected district school boards, flood control district boards, water resource planning boards, transit authority boards and the like. \[See also: autocracy , civil liberties , checks and balances , tyranny, ideology , federation , dictatorship , popular sovreignty , totalitarianism \]

Sequestration
  Originally a legal term referring generally to the act of valuable property being taken into custody by an agent of the court and locked away for safekeeping, usually to prevent the property from being disposed of or abused before a dispute over its ownership can be resolved. But the term has been adapted by Congress in more recent years to describe a new fiscal policy procedure originally provided for in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Deficit Reduction Act of 1985 -- an effort to reform Congressional voting procedures so as to make the size of the Federal government's budget deficit a matter of conscious choice rather than simply the arithmetical outcome of a decentralized appropriations process in which no one ever looked at the cumulative results until it was too late to change them. If the dozen or so appropriation bills passed separately by Congress provide for total government spending in excess of the limits Congress earlier laid down for itself in the annual Budget Resolution, and if Congress cannot agree on ways to cut back the total (or does not pass a new, higher Budget Resolution), then an &quot;automatic&quot; form of spending cutback takes place. This automatic spending cut is what is called &quot;sequestration.&quot; Under sequestration, an amount of money equal to the difference between the cap set in the Budget Resolution and the amount actually appropriated is &quot;sequestered&quot; by the Treasury and not handed over to the agencies to which it was originally appropriated by Congress. In theory, every agency has the same percentage of its appropriation withheld in order to take back the excessive spending on an &quot;across the board&quot; basis. However, Congress has chosen to exempt certain very large programs from the sequestration process (for example, Social Security and certain parts of the Defense budget), and the number of exempted programs has tended to increase over time -- which means that sequestration would have to take back gigantic shares of the budgets of the remaining programs in order to achieve the total cutbacks required, virtually crippling the activities of the unexempted programs. The prospect of sequestration has thus come to seem so catastrophic that Congress so far has been unwilling actually to let it happen. Instead, Congress has repeatedly chosen simply to raise the Budget Resolution spending caps upward toward the end of the legislative session in order to match the actual totals already appropriated, thus largely wiping out the incentives that the reformed budget procedures were expected to provide for Congress to get better control of the budget deficit. \[See also: impoundment, budget deficit, fiscal policy, appropriation bill\]

Socialism
socialism
socialist
  A class of [ref]ideologies favoring an economic system in which all or most productive resources are the property of the government, in which the production and distribution of goods and services are administered primarily by the government rather than by private enterprise, and in which any remaining private production and distribution (socialists differ on how much of this is tolerable) is heavily regulated by the government rather than by market processes . Both democratic and non-democratic socialists insist that the government they envision as running the economy must in principle be one that truly reflects the will of the masses of the population (or at least their &quottrue&quot best interests), but of course they differ considerably in their ideas about what sorts of political institutions and practices are required to ensure this will be so. In practice, socialist economic principles may be combined with an extremely wide range of attitudes toward personal freedom, civil liberties , mass political participation, bureaucracy and political competition, ranging from Western European democratic socialism to the more authoritarian socialisms of many third world regimes to the totalitarian excesses of Soviet-style socialism or communism . \[See also: communism , welfare state , anarchism , democracy , civil rights/civil liberties , totalitarianism , market economy , egalitarianism \]

Specialization
  In the economic sense, the social phenomenon of individual human beings or organizations each concentrating their productive efforts on a rather limited range of tasks. Specialization entails focussing on a narrow area of knowledge or skill or activity. It involves a person's or an organization's adapting for the unusually effective or efficient performance of some particular function, often at the expense of the individual's or organization's ability to perform most other functions for themselves, which are then necessarily left to others with more appropriate skills or talents or abilities. \[For a related concept, see division of labor \] Like the division of labor, specialization generally comes about because it is discovered (usually by trial and error) that the individuals or groups concerned can increase their productivity (and hence, under a market economy, their incomes) through greater specialization according to the principle of comparative advantage. \[See also: [ref]comparative advantage , division of labor , human capital , productivity \]

Stare decisis
  Literally, &quot;Let the decision stand.&quot; The policy or practice of judges to abide by the legal rules or principles already established in earlier cases of the same sort. \[See also: judicial restraint\]

State
  A specialized type of political organization characterized by a full-time, specialized, professional work force of tax-collectors, soldiers, policemen, bureaucrats and the like that exercises supreme political authority over a defined territory with a permanent population, independent from any enduring external political control and possessing a local predominance of coercive power (always supplemented with moral and remunerative incentives as well) great enough to maintain general obedience to its laws or commands within its territorial borders. The first known states were created in ancient times in Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, Mexico and Peru, but it is only in relatively modern times that states have almost completely displaced alternative &quotstateless&quot forms of political organization of societies all over the planet. (Roving bands of hunter-gatherers and even fairly sizable and complex tribal societies based on herding or agriculture have existed without any full-time specialized state organization, and these &quotstateless&quot forms of political organization have in fact prevailed for all of the prehistory and much of the history of the human species.) One of the component territorial political units in a larger federal state that are so called because, although they actually fall short of full independent statehood or sovereignty, they still possess a very large degree of autonomy in decision-making with respect to most of their internal affairs and are thus also legally allowed to exercise various forms of coercion over their regional populations \[Example -- the 50 states of the United States.\]. \[See also: nation state , legitimacy , incentives , legitimacy , incentives , ideology , confederation , federation , empire , republic , aristocracy , oligarchy , monarchy , dictatorship , democracy , anarchy , theocracy , autocracy , tyranny, bureaucracy , tax \]

Subsidy
  In general, a special money payment by a government to one or more firms in a favored industry, usually for the purpose of enabling them to sell one or more of their products at a price below their costs of production (or at least at a price below the free market price). Subsidies are typically advocated either to promote more widespread consumption of some good or service deemed to be especially essential or meritorious by the government (&quotmerit goods&quot), to boost the levels of production of goods whose manufacture or consumption involves sizable &quotpositive externalities&quot or partake of the nature of &quotpublic goods,&quot, or sometimes simply to stave off bankruptcy and unemployment in a declining industry or segment of an industry whose owners and/or workers enjoy a lot of political influence. \[See also: externalities , public goods , merit goods \]

Substitute goods
  Two (or more) products for which the demand schedules are related to each other in such a way that an increase in the price of one good (other things being equal) will result in a rightward shift of the entire demand schedule for the other good, so that more of the second good will then be demanded at any given available price of the second good. (By the same token, a decrease in the price of the first good will result in a leftward shift of the entire demand schedule for its substitute, so that less of the substitute good will then be demanded at any given available price for the substitute than before.) This kind of relationship occurs when the two kinds of goods can be consumed or used in place of each other in at least some of their common uses. (Of course, substitutability of one for the other is a matter of degree, ranging from almost perfect interchangeability to only partial interchangeability.) The relative costs of using one good versus its substitute is apt to play a major role in determining which one each user chooses to purchase. An example of substitutable consumer goods might be compact disks and cassette tapes, both of which can be used as media for selling recorded musical performances to the public, even though there are significant differences between the two in terms of sound quality, durability, and the cost of the equipment needed to play them. Essentially these represent alternative choices for the consumers, and the relative prices of the two alternatives are going to have a lot to do with which way many consumers will go in spending their music budgets. If the price of cassettes suddenly increases a good bit, other things being equal, we can expect cd sales to be larger at any given price than they would have been with cassettes still at the old price. Examples of substitutable producers' goods might include coal versus natural gas (versus fuel oil versus nuclear fuels versus windmills etc) as alternative means to power generators for producing electricity. If the price of coal increases sharply, one may expect demand for the various substitutes to be greater at any of their given prices than would have been the case if the coal price had remained unchanged. This is because at least some electricity producers will now find it financially worth their while to shift part or all of their electricity production over to these suddenly relatively cheaper technologies. (Another common pattern is for various sorts of skilled or unskilled labor to be fairly substitutable in particular industries for each other and/or for various forms of labor-saving machinery because of the existence of alternative production technologies available for producing the same goods or services. If the price of purchasing electronic teller machines goes down, for example, other things being equal, banks' demand for human bank tellers is likely to be reduced.) \[See also: [ref]complementary goods , competition , monopoly , demand , demand schedule \]

Supply
  The willingness and ability of potential sellers to offer various specific amounts of a good or service for sale at each of a variety of alternative prices during a particular time period. \[See also: law of supply, supply schedule, supply curve, demand\]

Supply curve
  A graphical representation of a supply schedule. Conventionally, the supply curve is drawn between axes with price plotted along the vertical axis and number of units of the good or service supplied plotted along the horizontal axis. Where the law of supply applies to the particular market under consideration, the supply curve will slope (either gently or steeply) upwards from left to right. \[See also: supply, supply schedule\]

Supply schedule
  A table or listing showing the exact quantities of a single type of good (or service) that potential sellers would offer to sell at each of a number of varying prices during some particular time period. Supply schedules may be drawn up to reflect the behavioral propensities of a single unique individual, household, or firm -- or, more frequently encountered in microeconomic analysis, composite supply schedules for the particular good may be derived by adding up all the supply schedules of the large number of individuals, households or firms that are active or potentially active as sellers in the market under consideration. \[See also: supply, law of supply, supply curve, market\]

Supply-side economics
  A school of thought within the economics profession emphasizing that the main source of a country's economic growth is constant improvement in the efficiency with which resources are allocated for production. While the policy recommendations of the rival Keynesian school tend to focus almost entirely on what government can do to stimulate or restrain aggregate demand in the short-run so as to even out the business cycle, supply-side policy analysts focus on barriers to higher productivity -- identifying ways in which the government can promote faster economic growth over the long haul by removing impediments to the supply of, and efficient use of, the factors of production. Supply-siders believe that unwise provisions of the tax laws (and especially high marginal rates of personal and [ref]corporate income [ref]taxation) produce very damaging [ref]incentives that lead people to work less and to invest less (and to do both less efficiently) than they otherwise would. Supply-side policy recommendations typically include deregulation of heavily regulated industries, promotion of greater competition through lowering [ref]protectionist barriers to international trade, and measures to repeal special subsidies and tax loopholes targeting particular industries in favor of lower and more uniform tax rates across the board. Supply-side economics became particularly well-known to the general public during the 1980s because of its advocacy by one influential faction of economic policy-makers in the Reagan administration, leading to the use of the term &quot;Reaganomics&quot; to denote many of the ideas of the supply-siders. Supply-siders played a much smaller role in economic policy-making under the Bush administration, as the focus of attention shifted toward controlling the size of the budget deficit and away from the earlier &quot;Reaganomics&quot; preoccupation with accelerating the country's rate of economic growth.

law of Supply
  Other things being held constant, the higher the price of a good (or service), the larger the quantity of that good (or service) that will be offered for sale in a particular time period. \[See also: [ref]supply, [ref]supply curve, [ref]law of diminishing returns, [ref]marginal analysis, [ref]marginal productivity\] 

Systems theory models of decision-making
  General systems theory emphasizes the way in which organized systems (human and non-human) respond in an adaptive way to cope with significant changes in their external environments so as to maintain their basic structures intact. Systems theory models of decision-making in human groups and organizations emphasize their interaction with &quotoutside&quot actors and organizations and concentrate on identifying the particular elements in the environment of the group or organization that significantly affect the outcomes of its decision-making. To understand what an organization did, try to find out what threat or opportunity it was responding to and how its pre-existing response mechanisms worked to do this. \[See also: rational-comprehensive decision-making , incrementalism (incrementalist decision-making) , bureaucracy , bureaucratic politics , organizational process models of decision-making \]

Tariff
  A tax imposed on goods imported from outside the country that is not imposed on similar goods from within the country. Import tariffs may be levied on an ad valorem basis, i.e., as a certain percentage of the estimated market value of the imported item; or on a &quotspecific&quot basis, i.e., as a fixed dollar amount per unit imported. Import tariffs (or &quotduties&quot) may be imposed mainly for the purpose of raising revenues because they are relatively cheap and easy taxes for a small or poorly organized government to collect, but more usually in developed industrial societies they represent a tiny fraction of revenues and are imposed primarily for other reasons of economic policy. &quotProtective&quot tariffs allow domestic producers of the good in question an artificial competitive advantage over their foreign competitors (largely at the expense of domestic consumers of these products) by making it impossible for the foreign producer to sell his goods as cheaply as he otherwise would -- thus allowing favored domestic producers to enjoy higher prices, a bigger market share, and bigger profits. \[See also: tax, taxation , protectionism \]

Tax, taxation
Tax
taxation
  A compulsory transfer of money (or occasionally of goods or services) from private individuals, institutions or groups to the state. The amount and timing of the levy exacted from the individual taxpayer may be determined on the basis of any of a very large number of factors, but historically the most common sorts of tax have been levied based on the wealth or the income or some other characteristic of the particular taxpayer at a given time (&quotdirect taxes&quot like income tax, social security tax, real property tax, estate tax, poll tax, business or professional license fees) or as some form of compulsory surcharge on one or more types of private trade or other voluntary transactions (&quotindirect taxes&quot like general sales taxes, specialized excise taxes, import tariffs, marriage licenses, and so on). In addition to the obvious function of raising revenue to finance government purchases of goods and services or income transfer programs, taxation may also be used deliberately as a policy instrument by which government seeks to influence the behavior of various segments of the citizenry by raising the costs of choosing to engage in the kinds of behavior on which taxes are imposed -- the classic examples being &quotsin&quot taxes to discourage consumption of tobacco and alcohol or protective import tariffs imposed to discourage the purchase of foreign-made products. (Of course, all forms of taxation will have an impact on the incentives facing the citizenry and thus will affect their behavior -- but frequently these non-revenue effects will not have been analyzed in advance and therefore do not represent deliberate policy. Legislators are rather regularly astonished by the unexpected -- and often negative -- secondary effects of their enactments, such as cigarette tax increases in New York producing diminished revenues due to increases in smuggling of cheap untaxed cigarettes, or newly imposed luxury taxes on yachts meant to soak the rich creating mass blue-collar unemployment in the boat-building industry due to greatly diminished sales.) \[See also: tariff , protectionism , demerit good , fiscal policy , elasticity , incentives \]

Theocracy
  A form of government in which the clergy exercise or bestow all legitimate political authority and in which religious law is dominant over civil law and enforced by state agencies. \[See also: legitimacy, ideology, state\]

Tort
  Legal term. A wrongful or injurious act (other than breaking a contract) for which a civil suit may be brought in court by private persons. If the suit is successful, the court may award the victims cash compensation for damages, &quot;punitive&quot; damages above the actual cost of the injury in order to punish the defendent, and/or a court order banning any future repetitions of the kind of behavior giving rise to the suit. For example, a householder might sue the owners of a nearby factory for creating excessive noise or pollution that interferes unreasonably with the householder's health or the peaceful enjoyment of his property. Tort law procedures are thus one of the principal mechanisms for defining and protecting property rights short of evoking criminal law and is an important governmental mechanism for trying to overcome the problem of negative externalities. \[See also: contract, property rights, externality, judicial activism, judicial restraint, common law\]

Totalitarianism
  Domination by a single, like-minded governing elite of all (or virtually all) organized political, economic, social and cultural activities in a country by means of a single-party monopoly of power, police repression not only of all forms of dissent and opposition but also of all forms of independent private organizations as such, rigorous censorship of the mass media, centralized state planning and administration of the economy, and pervasive propaganda to inculcate the principles of the obligatory official ideology. Totalitarian states differ from traditional dictatorships or despotisms primarily with respect to the broader (&quottotal&quot) scope of human behavior that the authorities seek to regulate in detail and with respect to their much more effective control mechanisms made possible by exploiting twentieth century breakthroughs in rapid communication and transportation, scientific psychology, pervasive mass media, surveillance technology, electronic information retrieval, and so on. The term is commonly applied both to fascist regimes and communist regimes, and occasionally by extension to other exotic cults, movements or regimes with ambitions for total control such as those led by various sorts of religious fanatics like the Rev. Jim Jones or the Ayatollah Khomeini. \[See also: fascism , communism , theocracy , ideology , propaganda , civil rights/civil liberties , state , tyranny\]

Trade-off
  When choices are made (collectively or by an individual) to accept having less of one thing in order to get more of something else, the results are called trade-offs. For example, when one is allocating (limited) funds, the trade-off usually involves reduced spending for some purposes in order to be able to spend more for other more urgent purposes. However, the concept does not apply only (or even primarily) to decisions involving money. A student faced with the choice of spending Saturday studying for a Political Economy exam or shopping at The Mall makes a trade-off of shopping time for study time in deciding how many hours to study and how many to spend shopping. Society also makes trade-offs -- such as, for example, between its need for a more plentiful supply of energy and its need to prevent excessive deterioration of the environment caused by energy production technologies. Evaluating trade-offs, when done carefully and systematically, involves comparing the [ref]costs \[see opportunity cost\] and benefits of each of the available alternatives with each other. Most choices (and thus most trade-offs) are not all-or-nothing decisions; rather they typically involve small changes at the margin -- a little more of this at the cost of a little less of that. \[see marginal analysis\] Consumers continuously practice marginalism and make trade-offs as they consider whether to buy one more unit or one unit less of a good or service in their efforts to obtain a mix of goods and services that afford them the greatest satisfaction for their available buying power. Producers must constantly be deciding (and reevaluating) their trade-offs in choosing whether to produce somewhat more or somewhat less of a particular product, whether to add a few more workers or lay a few off, whether to invest in more plant and equipment or whether to close down some of existing capacity, and so on -- in their efforts to maximize profits.

Transaction costs
  The costs other than the money price that are incurred in trading goods or services. Before a particular mutually beneficial trade can take place, at least one party must figure out that there may be someone with which such a trade is potentially possible, search out one or more such possible trade partners, inform him/them of the opportunity, and negotiate the terms of the exchange. All of these activities involve opportunity costs in terms of time, energy and money. If the terms of the trade are to be more complicated than simple &quotcash on the barrelhead&quot (for example, if the agreement involves such complications as payment in installments, prepayment for future delivery, warranties or guarantees for quality, provision for future maintenance and service, options for additional future purchases at a guaranteed price, etc.), negotiations for such a detailed contract may itself be prolonged and very costly in terms of time, travel expenses, lawyers' fees, and so on. After a trade has been agreed upon, there may also be significant costs involved in monitoring or policing the other party to make sure he is honoring the terms of the agreement (and, if he is not, to take appropriate legal or other actions to make him do so). These are the main sorts of transaction costs, then: search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, policing and enforcement costs. Elementary versions of economic theorizing often make the simplifying assumption that information and other transaction costs are zero (and, indeed, in a generally law-abiding society with a stable money system, cheap transportation and cheap communications, they are often pretty negligible). But realism nevertheless demands that we keep in mind the fact that the benefits to the participants in an exchange have to be high enough to cover their transaction costs if the trade is to take place at all. Indeed, many otherwise mutually advantageous trades do not take place because of the very high transaction costs that would be involved. High transaction costs are very often at the root of the problems discussed under the heading of externalities , especially in those situations where the external costs or benefits accrue to very large numbers of third parties and therefore a contractual agreement to internalize the externality is extremely costly to negotiate. \[See also: externalities , cost , barter , money \]

Transfer payment
transfer payment
  A payment of money by the government to an individual that does not form part of an exchange but rather represents a gift without anything being received or required in return. Examples of transfer payments would include student scholarship grants, welfare checks, and social security benefits. Establishing programs providing for transfer payments from the budget to particular favored categories of the population represent one of the most direct ways in which a government may pursue policies of income redistribution.

Unemployment
  A situation which exists when members of the labor force wish to work at the prevailing wage or salary rates for their skills, but cannot get a job. The concept thus refers to &quotinvoluntary&quot unemployment only, rather than the voluntary decision of someone to choose leisure (or productive activity outside the cash economy such as housewifery) rather than gainful employment at prevailing rates of pay. Most post-World War II governments have made it a major goal of their economic policies to keep total unemployment in their national economies at relatively low levels (subject to certain practical constraints and trade-offs imposed by their pursuit of other important goals such as economic growth, low inflation , competitiveness in international trade, and so on). \[See also: unemployment rate , Phillips' curve , trade-off , macroeconomics \]

Unemployment rate
unemployment rates
rate of unemployment
  A measure of the extent of unemployment in the labor force at some particular time, expressed as a percentage of the total available labor force. Nearly all national governments now have some statistical agency or department charged with gathering the necessary data and estimating the unemployment rate at frequent intervals (monthly or quarterly) for the guidance of policy-makers. In broad terms the underlying concepts are pretty similar from one country to the next: the number of people classified as [ref]unemployed is to be divided by the number of people classified as being in the available labor force, with the result expressed in percentage terms. However, differences from country to country in classification rules and practical data collection methods used for estimating both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction make precise international comparison of unemployment rates very difficult, if not impossible. The use of jobless totals derived from the agencies that distribute unemployment insurance benefits is particularly suspect but nevertheless widely practiced by some countries' official statistical agencies. For example, some people may falsely claim they would accept a job offer at current wage rates when in fact they are making no effort (or only a token show of effort) to locate such a job, misreporting their intentions so that they may continue to draw unemployment benefits for a time. Other people may be actively, even desperately, seeking a job and yet not show up in such a count because they are technically ineligible for unemployment benefits (perhaps through lack of previous work experience or through having exhausted the time-limit) and so do not bother to report the success or failure of their job-hunting efforts to the government unemployment office. (Well-designed sample surveys of the population or of employers have much better validity for measuring the true unemployment rate but still have credibility problems of their own. For example, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people who are really gainfully employed but whose work is in illegal activities -- such as bootlegging, prostitution, drug-dealing, loan-sharking, illegal gambling operations, smuggling, or simply working conventional trades &quotoff the books&quot to avoid taxes -- cheerfully deny having a job when questioned by government pollsters in suits who might well inform on them to the police.) \[See also: unemployment \]

Utility
  An economic concept referring to the precise degree of personal satisfaction, pleasure, or sense of want-fulfillment an individual derives from consuming some quantity of a good or service at a particular point in time. Obviously no two persons assign identical utilities to any given good because human tastes and preferences vary sharply. Nor is there any standard objective unit in which both &quot;utility for me&quot; and &quot;utility for thee&quot; can be measured and compared to each other. But presumably each of us can at least roughly compare the utilities of various possible goods (or combinations of goods) to ourselves and decide &quot;since I have to choose, I would much rather have this than that, all things considered.&quot; The concept of precisely measurable utility was at the heart of the derivation of the classical theory of demand, in the form of the law of diminishing marginal utility. Nowadays, most theorists prefer the derivation of demand derived from the &quot;indifference curve&quot; analysis popularized in the 1930s by J.R. Hicks, which reaches essentially the same conclusions as the older utility analysis, without the unnecessary assumption that individuals are capable of measuring their own utilities in so precise a fashion. \[See also: marginal analysis\]

Veto
  A privileged single vote that, according to some systems of rules for decision-making, has the effect of blocking or negating a majority decision. In the United States, the President may veto a bill passed by majorities in both houses of Congress, preventing it from becoming law unless each house then re-passes the bill by a two-thirds majority. In the United Nations Security Council, a negative vote (veto) by even one of the five permanent member states (the USA, Russia, Britain, France and China) has the effect of defeating any proposed Security Council resolution. \[See also: line-item veto, separation of powers, checks and balances\]

Welfare state
  A state whose government devotes a very large proportion of its activities and expenditures to the direct provision of personal benefits to be consumed by qualifying individuals or families (as contrasted with such more traditional and less individually divisible government activities as national defense, law enforcement, [ref]controlling the money supply , economic regulation, maintaining transportation and communications nets, administering the public lands, etc.). Welfare benefits to individuals may be in the form either of [ref]bureaucratically supplied professional services of government employees or in the form of government-issued stipends or allowances or [ref]subsidies (transfer payments ) to help qualifying households pay for general subsistence or for specific categories of state-favored expenses (merit goods ). Examples of such social welfare programs would include old age and disability pensions, unemployment benefits, aid to families with dependent children, income supplements for the poor, public housing and housing vouchers, health care provided in state hospitals or clinics and reimbursement for the costs of [ref]privately-provided health care, government-funded drug abuse rehabilitation programs, food stamps, public education and child care, etc. Advocacy of extensive &quotwelfare state&quot programs was at first associated mainly with [ref]socialist movements, but in most Western industrial societies today many welfare state programs are endorsed as well by non-socialist parties that nevertheless still continue to reject the socialists' traditional demands for [ref]much more extensive state ownership , state planning, and state administration of industry and commerce. \[See also: socialism , ideology , entitlement program , subsidy , merit good , transfer payment , state , bureaucracy \]
